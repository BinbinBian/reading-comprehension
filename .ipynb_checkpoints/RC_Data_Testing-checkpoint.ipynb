here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer \\'s dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . so if an officer is left - handed , the gun should be on the left side . @entity4 \\' attorney said his client is left - handed . but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . \" i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , \" @entity4 said in a written statement to investigators . after @entity4 announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he \" used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , \" said @entity11 , @entity4 \\' attorney . \" he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the @entity1 , \" @entity11 said . \" both the gun and the @entity1 have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . \" @entity11 also said his client \\'s left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , @entity4 said he had grabbed a \" pepper ball launcher \" to try to slow or stop @entity5 , who was running away . @entity4 did not say explicitly where the @entity1 was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was \" startled \" by the recoil of the gun . \" after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , \" he told investigators . @entity4 is now charged with second - degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot @entity5 turns himself in @entity4 was carrying his personal gun , a @entity12 .357 five - shot revolver , and a @entity1 , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the @entity5 family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . \" there \\'s no way an officer can get this confused with this , \" said one of the attorneys from the law firm of @entity13 , @entity14 & @entity15 . @entity16 \\'s @entity17 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than @entity12 .357 five - shot revolvers . sgt. @entity18 of the @entity19 -- which is separate from the county sheriff \\'s office for which @entity4 volunteered -- said @entity4 was the \" victim \" of something called \" slip and capture . \" that \\'s when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high - stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told @entity0 the claim amounts to \" junk science . \" \" there \\'s no peer - reviewed articles that would support this . ... it \\'s not generally accepted by the scientific community , \" said @entity20 , an assistant professor of criminal justice at @entity21 . \" so it \\'s something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . \" an attorney for the @entity5 family said the \" slip and capture \" theory has n\\'t held up in court . \" the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in @entity8 ( of @entity7 ) , \" the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to @entity22 . @entity23 , vice president for strategic communications at @entity1 , noted some of those differences to @entity0 : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a @entity1 , an led control panel lights up . there \\'s more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun \\'s . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , @entity23 said . @entity16 \\'s training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer \\'s nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , \" @entity1 ! taser ! taser ! \" as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer \\'s muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the @entity2 shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by @entity1 have been used more than 2.7 million times , @entity23 said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . @entity0 \\'s @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 contributed to this report .',\n",

       "  \"( @entity0 ) is @entity1 a nation divided ? and has @entity2 found a better way to bridge those divisions ? it 's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation : immigration , community and police relations , poverty , education and dozens of other crucial matters facing @entity1 . adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite , and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self - interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country . in @entity2 , we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services , criminal justice , economic competiveness , infrastructure -- and i 've enjoyed sharing our state 's winning formula with others in my travels . in 2011 , i returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in @entity3 in the 1980s and ' 90s . over the intervening years , @entity2 had lost its way and was hurting . i felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 @entity2 families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet . @entity2 is much stronger today . and that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing . for example , we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $ 8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation 's strongest state budgets and a nearly $ 2 billion surplus . we 've gone from losing 350,000 private - sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones . we 've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in @entity1 , including tax cuts for the working poor . we 're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and @entity2 's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade . getting @entity2 back on track was n't easy . it required big ideas , going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests . yes , we have a great success story to tell about our state . and we need to make @entity2 's success contagious . the leadership style that helped us turn around @entity2 is needed in @entity4 , where @entity1 's $ 18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting @entity5 if it required their action . great leaders are not primarily guided by polls , political parties , focus groups , re-election , special interests or protecting the status quo . instead they bring teams of people together , challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good . as the chairman of the @entity6 in @entity3 in the 1990s , i helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon . we worked in a bipartisan effort that does n't happen enough . there were , of course , disagreements along the way , but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means . given the polarizing issues facing our country , @entity1 needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego , selfishness and power produce . leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value - driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets , tax cuts , welfare reform , border security , immigration and health care . we see it every day . there are certain values that guide great countries : personal responsibility : it obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities . empathy : it allows us to walk in someone else 's shoes , so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another , better way that makes all of us stronger . teamwork : it sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win . faith : it tells us we are made special in the image of @entity7 with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth . these values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all @entity1 instead of producing rhetoric , sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform . in @entity2 we 've implemented this winning strategy . it 's worked there , and it will work for the nation as well .\",\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) on thursday , @entity1 -- headquartered in @entity2 , just 40 miles away from @entity3 -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25 - year - old @entity4 because of still - unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody . unfortunately , while it was a freshly produced segment , it was hardly a new story . titled \" @entity5 , \" the five - minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \" what \\'s really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city , \" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was african - americans \" targeting @entity6 - owned businesses for destruction . \" a similar claim was made after @entity7 \\'s uprising in august of last year . indeed , it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s , the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between @entity6 and black communities first took root in the media consciousness . yes , interethnic tensions continue to exist , though they are hardly limited to @entity8 and blacks . and yes , this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides . but while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year , black - owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence , there \\'s little evidence to suggest a pattern in which @entity6 businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus . instead , it seems as if @entity6 - owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods . in other words , they were collateral damage , along with other stores in the vicinity of riots . so it \\'s time to call this persistent meme what it is : a misleading , hyperbolic and dangerous distraction , one that shifts blame away from the real issues . as @entity9 , sociology professor at @entity10 , and author of the 2002 book \" @entity11 : blacks , jews and @entity12 in @entity13 , \" notes , \" the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor , disadvantaged communities . by directing our attention to interminority conflict , it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems . \" let \\'s be honest . there were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely @entity14 customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences . there \\'s no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures . for example , in 1993 , the robbery and shooting of @entity15 , a 21 - year - old @entity16 at @entity17 , and the subsequent acquittal of his killer , was a point of contention between the @entity16 and @entity14 communities . but things are different now . decades after the height of media - inflamed tension between @entity6 and @entity14 , patterns of immigration have shifted . stores once operated by recent @entity16 immigrants are now owned by strivers from @entity18 , the @entity19 and @entity20 . the population of @entity3 has shrunk and its economy has contracted . among merchants , there \\'s ever - greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread , surviving or failing together . for decades , black and @entity6 advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities . for example , the @entity3 - based @entity21 of @entity22 , founded in 1995 , has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by @entity3 \\'s police , while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents . a kagro - sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the @entity3 neighborhoods their member retailers serve . these are n\\'t the kind of stories you \\'ll hear in the media . it \\'s easier to focus on attention - grabbing anecdotes rather than the long , hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities . back in 1995 , the @entity23 profiled soon @entity24 and @entity25 , owners of @entity15 \\'s @entity26 in the @entity27 @entity3 \\'s @entity28 neighborhood -- the same part of the city that @entity1 called out as a locus of @entity6 - black tension . the story highlighted the @entity29 \\' openness to the community , their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity , which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year . i spoke with @entity25 , calling her without warning to check on the status of the @entity30 \\' four - decade - old business after the violence of monday and tuesday . were they open ? were they safe ? \" oh , of course we \\'re open , we \\'re always open ! \" said mrs. @entity9 , warmly and brightly . \" this week , many customers came in and said to me \\' mrs. @entity9 , do n\\'t worry you are part of our community , you are our family . we will make sure you are ok -- just stay open ! \\' we love it . we love it . \" and yet , no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market , nor have they talked with her customers , stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage . reinforcing the tired narrative of black - @entity6 interracial tension generates heat , but not light . there \\'s a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations , one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told , not buried under cliches and clickbait .',\n",
       "  '@entity0 ( @entity1 ) until recently , if you sat in church on sunday mornings , pollsters could predict where you stood on same - sex marriage . what a difference a decade makes . in 2003 , when the @entity2 became the country \\'s first to legalize same - sex marriage , less than 30 % of religiously affiliated @entity3 supported gays \\' and lesbians \\' right to wed. by 2014 , that number had climbed to 47 % , according to a survey conducted by the @entity4 . that \\'s more than the 45 % who said they opposed same - sex nuptials . the margin is small but statistically significant , said @entity5 , ceo of @entity4 , because of the exceptionally large pool of respondents : 40,000 adult @entity3 . ( eight percent refused to answer or said they did n\\'t know their stance on same - sex marriage . ) according to @entity4 \\'s poll , there are now more people of faith who favor marriage equality than stand against it , a dramatic turn in one of this country \\'s most divisive debates and a generational shift with the potential to sweep through everything from the wedding industry to the 2016 presidential race . \" there \\'s been a huge swing in the last decade , \" said @entity5 . \" there are now big , mainstream groups on both sides of the debate . \" if the @entity3 @entity2 has been paying attention , it likely saw this trend coming . each time the high court has considered a case related to same - sex marriage , the pile of amicus briefs from religious groups supporting gay rights has inched a little taller , and the crowds protesting outside their grand marble steps has gradually grown more diverse . on tuesday , for example , as the @entity2 hears oral arguments in @entity6 v. @entity7 , a case widely expected to produce a landmark ruling on same - sex marriage , an interfaith coalition of clergy led by the dean of @entity0 \\'s @entity8 is planning to march in support of lgbt rights . \" i join with many across the spectrum of @entity3 faith communities in my hope that the @entity2 \\'s ruling will permit same - sex marriage in all 50 states , \" the very rev. @entity9 , the cathedral \\'s dean , said in a statement . \" i trust that their judgment will end discrimination against those who seek @entity10 \\'s blessing on their marriages . \" clergy from @entity9 \\'s religious denomination , the @entity11 , have also submitted an amicus brief in support of same - sex marriage . the brief is endorsed by nearly 2,000 faith leaders , including rabbis , @entity12 ministers , @entity13 bishops , seminary professors and @entity14 chaplains . another brief , submitted by the @entity15 , is signed by @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 groups . in a reverse of traditional arguments against gay marriage , some members of these groups say their religious rights will be curtailed if states do not allow them to perform same - sex nuptials . prominent and powerful religious groups are lined up on the other side as well , including the @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and the @entity23 , also known as the @entity24 church . together , leaders of these faiths represent more than 120 million @entity3 . but as @entity4 \\'s survey shows , there are often differences of opinion between the pulpits and the pews . despite vocal opposition from the @entity3 @entity25 , for example , 60 % of @entity26 now favor same - sex marriage . that \\'s a huge increase from 2003 , when just 35 % backed gay rights , according to survey conducted at the time by the @entity27 . @entity28 -- so - called for their prominence in 20th century @entity3 life -- also saw a huge shift in the last decade . while 36 % supported same - sex marriage in 2003 , now 62 % do . at a glance , the pro-gay marriage faction is now strikingly diverse , encompassing @entity29 , @entity26 , @entity16 and @entity30 . but the pro-traditional marriage crowd is just as motley , bridging black @entity28 , mormons , @entity31 and white evangelicals , according to @entity4 \\'s survey . same - sex marriage rights worldwide legalized nationwide : @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 legalized in certain regions : @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity3 civil unions or domestic partnerships : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity43 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and parts of @entity63 , @entity44 , @entity3 and @entity64 the survey data comes from @entity4 \\'s @entity65 , conducted between april and december of last year . @entity4 is a nonpartisan , nonprofit research group that focuses on faith and @entity3 culture . separate surveys conducted by @entity4 and other groups show much of the newfound religious support for same - sex marriage is coming from younger @entity3 . seven in 10 @entity66 , for example , support same - sex marriage and say that faith groups alienate young adults by being judgemental on sexual ethics . half of millennial republicans say gays and lesbians should be allowed to marry , and 43 % of white evangelical millennials agree . those numbers could put @entity67 presidential candidates in a tight spot , said @entity5 , as they try to expand their base and appeal to younger @entity3 . \" the real challenge for @entity67 candidates is how can they plant their feet deftly enough not to offend older conservatives in the primaries but still be able to pivot in the general election to a younger generation , \" @entity5 said . politicians may pivot on same - sex marriage , but @entity68 - believing @entity69 should not -- even if public opinion turns against them , said @entity70 , a professor at @entity71 , a @entity21 school in @entity72 , @entity73 . \" for me , the number of people who come to the message is not the main issue . there are periods when the @entity74 is popular and periods when it \\'s not . you ca n\\'t base your evaluation of its truthfulness on its popularity at a given historical moment . \" still , @entity70 said he does n\\'t doubt that more millennials accept same - sex marriage , and he fully expects the @entity2 to legalize gay weddings countrywide this june when the justices render a decision in @entity6 v. @entity7 . but the fight is far from over , @entity70 said . \" just like we \\'ve seen this decades -

time adversaries . and even though many @entity1 have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal , the leadership in @entity22 and @entity0 is far more skeptical . in a recent televised speech , @entity21 said it was possible that there would be no deal by the june 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all . and @entity1 \\'s army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites . meanwhile , the @entity23 has been confronted by a @entity24 that is largely hostile to the negotiations , and has been making the case that a deal can not be about trust , but about monitoring and verification . \" our main concern here is making sure that if @entity1 does n\\'t abide by its agreement , that we do n\\'t have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions , \" @entity4 president @entity25 said last friday . \" that \\'s our main concern . and i think that goal , of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation , that goal can be met . \" so far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week . but despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air , there is also fear that things could fall apart if @entity0 and @entity22 are n\\'t willing to make tough concessions .',\n",

time adversaries . and even though many @entity1 have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal , the leadership in @entity22 and @entity0 is far more skeptical . in a recent televised speech , @entity21 said it was possible that there would be no deal by the june 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all . and @entity1 \\'s army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites . meanwhile , the @entity23 has been confronted by a @entity24 that is largely hostile to the negotiations , and has been making the case that a deal can not be about trust , but about monitoring and verification . \" our main concern here is making sure that if @entity1 does n\\'t abide by its agreement , that we do n\\'t have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions , \" @entity4 president @entity25 said last friday . \" that \\'s our main concern . and i think that goal , of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation , that goal can be met . \" so far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week . but despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air , there is also fear that things could fall apart if @entity0 and @entity22 are n\\'t willing to make tough concessions .',\n",

@entity1 : right now in the last 18 years i have been active on the continent , i have never seen so much global excitement around @entity4 that i \\'ve seen today . the climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved . unfortunately , it \\'s one of those cases where perception is so different from reality . the reality on the ground is so much better than the perception . you \\'ve got to remember , as @entity4 , we are 54 countries . some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues , but that can not be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit . @entity0 : why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the @entity9 continent ? at : we have a very young demographic -- 85 % of our populations are under the age of 35 . we have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture . yet , entrepreneurship is not in the education system . where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance ? and it \\'s something , frankly , that i am extremely passionate about , because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants , etc. it \\'s going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises . so , it \\'s great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system , and innovation is totally embedded into that . @entity0 : what is it about @entity4 that encourages innovation ? at : the biggest advantage we have at the moment , and you \\'ve seen this with mobile phone penetration , is that we do n\\'t have legacy systems . we did n\\'t have landlines and we did n\\'t need them . we did n\\'t have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere . we leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony . today , we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than @entity13 and @entity14 put together . we can actually leapfrog in so many different ways . mobile money is another brilliant example . mobile money was created in @entity15 . the whole concept of having money on your phone , which is the best thing because it \\'s secure , it \\'s practical , made more sense . so , these kind of innovations , you \\'re going to see a lot more of on the continent . i spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when i travel across the continent , and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they \\'re coming up with is just so inspiring . @entity0 : what advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who \\'s just starting out ? at : entrepreneurship is a journey , it \\'s not a destination . there are going to be so many challenges , you are going to get knocked down so many times , but you \\'ve got to get up , dust yourself off and get back to it . the persistence , the passion , and staying on course is very crucial . you \\'ll be tempted to cut corners , you \\'ll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker , but it never lasts . people say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we \\'re not . we \\'re the leaders of today , but it \\'s our responsibility to take the seat at the table . @entity0 : what needs to be done most urgently to grow @entity9 economies ?

term business , and the @entity4 conflict is n\\'t ending anytime soon . so i decided to meet the guy . we spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $ 6,500 . some of the money would be deposited into an insurance company , with the usual transaction fees . when i reached @entity8 the money would be released to the smuggler -- or , if i changed my mind , i \\'d be able to get some of it back . \" be ready all day , every day for the next few days , because you might receive the call to go , \" the smuggler told me . one evening a few days later , i got the call and my journey began . they gathered 100 men and women in five buses and drove us to the smuggling point . it was far from @entity9 . we walked for 30 minutes , through rough terrain and orange farms near the beach , in darkness to avoid detection by police . the idea was to take us in three small boats to the main ship . i still remember an old lady , barely able to walk , with her two sons , marching along as fast as they could to try to reach the boats . they were told that if they did n\\'t walk faster , the boat would leave without them . i asked myself so many time what could possibly drive a normal person to put himself and his family in this kind of danger . i decided that anyone with a past but no future was capable of doing crazy things . finally we reached the boat . it was just as the smuggler described . for three days we waited in the boat for two other parties of 100 people to join us before departing . we were in the middle of the @entity2 , far enough away from the surrounding countries to be in international waters . on the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy , ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate , nameless numbers who never made it to the other side . but there was no going back -- it \\'s a one - way ticket . we sailed for eight hours before the boat \\'s engine broke down . there were around 300 of us on board , and as the waves began to push us towards @entity10 the crew sent a distress signal , hoping to alert maybe a @entity11 or @entity12 boat , anyone who could help us . eventually our boat hit a cliff and got stuck . luckily , before long , a @entity10 coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to @entity5 . @entity5 authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours . some of the people i had been traveling with said they were n\\'t going to try to make the trip again . when they asked me what i planned to do , i told them i would do it again tomorrow if i could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works , where no one is bigger than nature , where you can feel so small , no matter how big your dreams are . i \\'d already lost everything . my family did n\\'t know what i was doing , but i dreamed of being a human being who is treated like one . i was n\\'t going to stop . so i called the smuggler the same night i was released , and said i wanted to get on the next ship out . two days later i received the call , and again i headed to a smuggling point . this time , they had a bigger boat -- a cargo ship , in fact , maybe 85 meters long or more . it took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total , refugees from cities all over @entity4 . and for the first time , i began to feel like i was in jail , trapped in conditions no human should ever suffer . we lived in the hold . there were no mattresses or sheets , but we found some wooden planks to put our stuff on to keep it from getting wet . hundreds of migrants killed when boat capsizes for five days we had no food and little water . but at least it meant not having to make frequent trips to the \" toilet , \" if you could call it that , which was an old car tire covered with a piece of cloth . huge waves crashed against the ship from all angles and water leaked in from the ceiling as we slept on the cold metal floor of the ship , the smell of urine emanating from the corner . seven days in , despite the poor conditions , everything was going well and we were nearing the island - dotted seas near @entity13 . on the eleventh day , 200 miles off the coast of southern @entity8 our guides began to alert @entity8 authorities to our presence . we were adrift at sea , they told the authorities , with no captain or crew . and that was actually true -- we did n\\'t have a registered pilot , just one guy who had worked on this ship before . an @entity14 ship -- working in conjunction with @entity15 , the joint @entity16 border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from @entity17 . the rescue ship approached us but was unable to get close at first because the waves were so high . we knew we would have to wait some time before leaving our boat forever . the other refugees were waving their hands like children and then telling each other : \" stop waving , they \\'ve already seen us . \" i was one of the last 10 people to be rescued from the boat . i can still see it like it was yesterday ; it was the rebirth of a new life . why migrants head to @entity2 they took us to @entity18 , on @entity19 , where we finally reached land a day later . when we arrived , the first thing the @entity8 authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases . there was a man who was poisoned by the drinking water on the boat , a few pregnant women and old people who needed medical attention . they took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted . they were saying : \" we did n\\'t risk everything to be refugees . we are not going to give our fingerprints , even if they torture us . \" later that night a @entity20 - @entity8 man told us not to worry : \" they will not fingerprint you . \" they would simply take us to different camps and we could leave from there . twelve days after it began , our journey to @entity1 was over . i spent two days in @entity19 before making my way first to @entity21 with two @entity4 guys who had become friends . we decided to go to @entity22 and went to @entity23 first and ended up in a city called @entity24 . i did n\\'t know where my fellow travellers were heading , but i knew one thing : my dream of making it to @entity1 , no matter the cost and risk involved , had been achieved . it was worth it .',\n",

dominated government of former prime minister @entity17 to discriminate against the @entity12 community . the @entity13 was also sloppy in relying on private security firms like @entity1 without implementing rigorous measures to regulate their behavior . it also turned a blind eye to the way its own troops were treating @entity2 . all those factors contributed to a rising sense of injustice that is now being conveniently packaged by @entity10 to push its own version of @entity2 history . in \" the revived caliphate , \" @entity4 is invoked three times as the place where @entity2 sunnis who resisted the @entity13 ended up as a result of their betrayal by @entity16 who collaborated with the @entity13 . the publication first recounts attacks on @entity4 at the height of the @entity13 intervention by @entity18 in @entity2 ( @entity19 ) -- @entity10 \\' predecessor -- to free imprisoned \" sunnis \" who had been detained by the @entity13 . it then presents the @entity20 ( awakening ) of 2007 -- when @entity12 tribes collaborated with the @entity13 to fight @entity19 -- as a case of @entity21 resentment that led the tribes to hand over @entity19 members \" to the @entity13 , where they were put through severe torture in the likes of the prisons of @entity4 , \" according to the publication . it then links those two stories to the storming of the prison by @entity10 in 2013 to free those who had been tortured by \" the @entity13 and @entity16 \" ( as the publication puts it ) over ten years . in bridging a decade of history and in placing the @entity16 squarely in the category of \" enemy , \" @entity10 is sending a strong message that its current fight in @entity2 is about reversing longstanding injustices against @entity12 and restoring a sense of @entity12 belonging under the umbrella of the \" caliphate . \" the civilians killed by the @entity1 guards , like the @entity4 prisoners , were both @entity12 and @entity16 . but the repackaging of history by @entity10 -- in which the @entity22 regime is reinvented as a \" @entity12 \" regime that tried to stand up to the @entity13 and its @entity16 allies -- glosses over those nuances . the reproduced images of @entity4 prisoners in the aforementioned @entity10 publication , juxtaposed with images of civilian deaths as a result of @entity13 airstrikes against @entity10 targets , are presented as \" proof \" of the group \\'s narrative . and they are reinforced with text that frames @entity13 today as \" the air force of the @entity16 . \" it is becoming clear that @entity10 can not be defeated in @entity2 without buy - in from the country \\'s @entity12 . without @entity12 help , @entity10 will continue to frame the conflict as one where @entity12 are once again being attacked by the @entity13 and the @entity16 -- particularly as @entity16 militias have become a key part of the fight against the terror group in places like @entity23 . to balance out this @entity16 involvement , the @entity13 and @entity2 governments are counting on the establishment of a cross-sectarian @entity2 national guard , and hoping to resurrect the \" awakening \" to re-engage and unify the @entity12 under a nationalist umbrella . but those plans will not succeed unless serious steps are taken to ensure that good governance measures are in place to hold both @entity2 and all those affiliated with the @entity24 coalition to account . this should not just apply in the context of the current conflict -- so that scenarios like @entity4 and @entity1 are not repeated -- but also when the dust settles . good governance is the most effective antidote to sectarianism .',\n",

good question . if other nations had half as much of what we boast , they \\'d make a much better job with it . paradoxically , if we had just the @entity11 or @entity12 it would be easier . but we do n\\'t and trouble is @entity1 does n\\'t know how to exploit this treasure . take the @entity13 \\'s successful exhibition on @entity14 in 2013 : we have the real site in our backyard but the @entity15 made the best of it worldwide while the real @entity14 was -- and still is -- making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses . or , worse , @entity1 could n\\'t care less to promote its assets . as a travel writer i have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and it \\'s a battle : many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places . i find myself almost begging them , when it should be the other way round . the true but sad thing is that restyling in @entity1 is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors . @entity16 has already saved @entity17 \\'s @entity18 . the @entity11 is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand @entity19 , while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts . yet it \\'s not just a matter of scarce public resources or austerity - driven measures . it \\'s also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment , the care to cherish a country \\'s valuable monuments . and that \\'s because @entity1 have always lacked a sense of national belonging : @entity1 , despite its millenary history , is one of the world \\'s most modern states , unified in 1861 . @entity20 @entity21 once said : \" now that we \\'ve made @entity1 , we need to make @entity1 . \" tough job indeed , and we \\'re still a long way to go . there \\'s also wide - spread approach that tends to limit restyling in general . heritage authorities are in love with the romantic ideal \" of decadent ruins \" : better leave the monument or site as it is , even allow it to rot , rather than recover it and \" destroy its original beauty . \" each time new subway works bring to light an unknown @entity2 theatre or necropoli , it all freezes - the public works and the artistic upkeep . preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion . but that \\'s a blind approach . there \\'s so much @entity1 could do with what it has , that it could live off tourism . @entity22 estimates that culture and art , if well exploited , could generate a turnover of 214 billion euros a year , amounting to 15.3 % of gdp . another thorny issue is having a cheap culture . entrance tickets to the @entity11 , @entity1 \\'s top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists , cost a maximum of 12 euros . @entity23 \\'s rock crypts are 5 euros . not to mention churches featuring @entity24 \\'s works , which are free to enter . the first time i visited @entity25 in @entity26 , and @entity27 in @entity28 , i was shocked to find out i had to pay to get in . and it was quite expensive , too . one could argue that @entity1 does well to open for free the @entity29 \\'s doors , but probably in some \" critical \" cases a minimum cost to enter would n\\'t hurt . the country \\'s mindset needs to change , too . monuments and works of art are not dead , but living things that deserve to be sexed - up once in a while . if we do n\\'t have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance , why not give them over to other countries to run ? or sell them to rich businessmen ? similar options make state authorities \\' hair stand on end : they stress art belongs to the @entity1 people and should remain in public hands -- even if it \\'s inaccessible and unenjoyable . yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private , thriving multimedia museum ? the @entity30 \\' secret cellars are stacked with 2,500 forgotten masterpieces , which could be leased out to privates . curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved . but cobwebs and dust can do no harm , right ? our sunny piazzas , bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities \\' coffers . and who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo ? there are also 6,000 abandoned medieval \" ghost towns \" that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy . the state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for 50 years . since the project launch in 2012 so far just two restyles have worked out , one being a @entity8 villa in @entity31 turned into a deluxe spa resort . fine , @entity32 was n\\'t built in a day . but it could crumble in an hour .',\n",

year - old cleaner , says her family has had close friendships with @entity5 going back generations . \" there is no such thing as genocide , \" she says . \" other people are trying to create hostility between us . \" most @entity7 agree with @entity8 . ninety - one percent of @entity7 do not believe that the events of 1915 -- when , according to @entity5 , 1.5 million ethnic @entity5 were systematically killed in the final years of the @entity6 -- were genocide , according to a recent poll . it \\'s a sentiment shared by the @entity9 government , which denies that a genocide took place , maintaining that hundreds of thousands of @entity9 @entity10 and @entity5 @entity11 died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of @entity1 also disputes @entity5 \\'s count of the numbers killed , putting it at 300,000 . it \\'s a heavily disputed position -- the killings are widely viewed by scholars as genocide and the @entity5 government and diaspora are lobbying for wider recognition in the international community . @entity5 prime minister @entity12 said friday in statement that @entity1 \\'s @entity6 rulers had planned and carried out a \" monstrous crime \" in the years of @entity13 and called on more countries to recognize and condemn the genocide . many @entity5 living in @entity1 still feel treated as second - class citizens . however many have hope that @entity1 \\'s younger generation is more willing to accept that a genocide occurred than their parents . \" students are much , much more liberal , \" says @entity14 , whose grandparents escaped the mass killings . @entity15 is a member of the delegation for the @entity16 commemoration and is writing her @entity17 thesis on the issue at @entity18 . \" they have access to alternative information written in @entity19 , which is not taught in school ( in @entity1 ) . with more access to books , to alternative information , and with a larger democratization process , @entity1 will be able to face its history . \" a century after her @entity5 ancestors escaped death in @entity20 , @entity15 says she is frustrated that @entity1 is unwilling to accept what happened . \" your identity is denied by @entity1 , \" she says . \" they do not want to face this past . in @entity1 , the word @entity5 is still used as a curse . whenever you want to hurt somebody , you say , \\' you are like an @entity5 . \\' \" @entity15 says an admission of genocide by @entity1 would largely be symbolic . while her grandparents lost their land , she has returned to their villages and she recognizes that trying to reclaim it would be impossible . \" i do not believe that this is going to happen , \" she says of the territorial claims made by many @entity5 . \" one hundred years have passed . i went to my ancestors \\' land , and i saw those @entity5 lands full of @entity21 people , who have five to 16 children per family , and i saw that it \\'s not @entity22 . it \\'s not my homeland that i had in my imagination . \" a growing number of scholars and world leaders believe that what happened should be called genocide . @entity23 looks set to join the @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 and some 20 other countries in labeling the atrocity a \" genocide . \" two weeks ago the @entity28 referred to mass killings as \" the first genocide of the 20th century \" -- a move that infuriated @entity9 president @entity29 , who called the claim \" nonsense \" and recalled his ambassador to the @entity30 . some notable countries do not recognize the killings as genocide , including the @entity31 and @entity32 and earlier this week @entity33 president @entity34 , wary of damaging relations with @entity1 amid growing unrest in the @entity35 , did not use the word genocide . there are several reasons why @entity1 maintains its position on the issue . @entity7 say that to most people there the term \" genocide \" is associated with @entity36 -- not the beloved founders of modern @entity1 . last year , the @entity9 government expressed condolences to @entity5 , and accepted that hundreds of thousands of their ancestors died as they were marched out of cities and towns in @entity37 and @entity22 in the waning years of the @entity6 . but the government called it a \" necessary deportation \" during the messy and violent period of transition leading up to @entity13 -- when many @entity5 radicals were threatening to side with @entity38 . @entity1 says that there was never a deliberate , ethnically - driven effort to exterminate the @entity5 population . \" it was a wartime precaution , like the @entity33 relocated the @entity39 population during @entity40 , \" says dr. @entity41 , @entity42 . @entity41 dismisses the drive for the \" genocide \" label as little more than a propaganda campaign being waged by the @entity5 diaspora . politics and timing is another issue . at a time when president @entity29 is in full campaign mode ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections , he is attempting to assuage concerns about unemployment and slowed growth by drumming up nationalist fervor with promises of a \" @entity43 \" akin to the glory days of the @entity6 . it \\'s hardly the time to label the country \\'s founders as murderers . that would n\\'t play well with @entity7 , many of whom have gone through years of schooling that instilled in them a fierce pride in their past . in the same way that @entity33 schools often whitewashed the history of @entity33 settlers and their relations with @entity44 , @entity9 schools have long taken an airbrush to the \" @entity7 . \" the movement , which began in 1908 , was comprised of the army officers who were in power as the country transitioned from the hands of spoiled sultans to @entity45 -- the much - adored leader who came to power in 1923 and is credited with founding the modern @entity9 state . the taboo surrounding the use of the word genocide began to crack about a decade ago when two of @entity1 \\'s best - selling international authors , @entity46 and @entity47 , joined other intellectuals in raising the issue of whether the country \\'s forefathers had committed genocide . @entity46 and @entity47 were met with crushing resistance . they were harangued in the court of public opinion , and tried in real - life court on charges of \" insulting @entity48 . \" since 2003 , @entity9 schools have been forbidden from using the term genocide . calling the events of 1915 a genocide would undermine the very narratives the @entity7 hold most dear , says @entity49 , a senior analyst at @entity50 who has studied @entity9 - @entity5 relations for a decade . she says the country simply is n\\'t ready to dismantle the foundation it was built on , or stain the legacy of its founders . \" @entity1 is still too young and too insecure to rewrite its history and question the events unfolding at the establishment of the republic , \" @entity49 says . but in a statement issued to mark the anniversary of the killings , president @entity29 urged dialogue , saying \" ... as descendants of two ancient peoples who a hundred years ago shared the same destiny whether in joy or in sorrow , our common responsibility , and calling , today is to heal century old wounds and re-establish our human ties once again . @entity1 will not remain indifferent to this responsibility and will continue to do its utmost for friendship and peace . \" but there are other issues , including fears that an official recognition of genocide could unleash a flood of lawsuits against the @entity9 government . in 2006 , descendants of exiled @entity5 filed suit in a @entity33 court against two @entity23 banks for restitution of assets , based on evidence that @entity6 ministries required that seized @entity5 assets be turned over to the government and transferred to banks in @entity23 . one 97 - year - old @entity5 woman living in the @entity33 claims to have land deeds proving that her parents owned land that now houses an airport . her case is winding its way through the @entity9 court system , but her lawyer , @entity51 , says the genocide debate has no effect : \" we have deeds , so we are following the law and politics do n\\'t matter . \" others say that the genocide is distracting the country from more pressing issues between @entity1 and @entity5 , like the closed border between the two hostile neighbors . @entity52 , a foreign policy expert at @entity53 , one of @entity1 \\'s leading think tanks , argues that it is @entity5 , not @entity1 , which suffers most from the tensions surrounding the issue . and he says it is n\\'t in @entity5 \\'s best interest to push hard for a recognition of genocide that he does n\\'t believe will ever come . \" there \\'s no diplomatic relations between the countries , and that plays into why @entity7 think there \\'s a crazy diaspora obsessed with genocide , but that \\'s not true , \" @entity52 says . \" the best thing for @entity5 would be to enter into dialogue with @entity1 , normalize relations , and open the border . \" meanwhile , the publicity surrounding the anniversary on friday has prompted debate amongst @entity7 of all ages . on sunday there will be a conference at @entity54 on the atrocity -- one of few in @entity1 that openly uses the term genocide . @entity55 , a 21 - year - old art management student with bright pink lipstick , is one of the few @entity7 who believes that her country should change course . \" they keep referring to this as an \\' @entity5 incident \\' in quotations and ca n\\'t call it genocide , \" she says , boarding the metro to her classes at @entity56 . \" we should be ashamed of this and accept it . \"',\n",

\" and for liberals , who believe that government is there to do something , it \\'s this lack of definition that is surely so disconcerting about @entity2 . there are good grounds for a liberal primary challenge to @entity2 . the economy has revived under @entity14 but , say critics , largely to the benefit of @entity15 and the super-rich . the riots in @entity16 , @entity17 , were a painful reminder that the poor , particularly the nonwhite poor , have been left behind . @entity2 \\'s credentials as a fighter against inequality are mixed . it is true , as the @entity18 notes , that she has previously called for \" universal prekindergarten , equal pay for women , increases in the minimum wage , paid family leave , higher taxes on the wealthy and an expanded @entity19 for working - poor families . \" but she counts among her friends precisely those corporate people blamed by the occupy crowd for the country \\'s inequality . @entity2 is now , wisely , trying to distance herself from the @entity20 -- after all , its fundraising efforts among foreign interests are hardly the stuff of populist liberalism . then there is her foreign policy record . @entity2 voted in 2002 to authorize the @entity21 ( though in her memoir last year , she backed away from the vote , writing that she \" got it wrong . \" ) as secretary of state , she is easily associated in the mind of the left with such controversies as the war in @entity22 , the crisis in @entity23 and the collapse of the @entity24 regime in @entity25 . that some of these may have had little to do with her is beside the point . @entity2 is going to have to spend a sizeable amount of time during the primaries explaining and defending the things that occurred while she was working for the @entity14 administration . her personal ethics are on the agenda , too -- as demonstrated by the flap over her use of a private email account . these are the issues that her @entity5 rivals are running on . in @entity26 last week , both @entity27 and @entity28 attacked @entity15 , @entity27 adding that he had also opposed the @entity21 . both men questioned the wisdom of clintonian triangulation -- the idea that the @entity9 can be won , and the country successfully governed , by always seeking the middle ground . both men would be wise to focus on @entity26 ; to contrast a populist , folksy campaign with the distant , over-managed style of @entity2 . and both would do well to tap into a feeling that it would be unhealthy , undemocratic and plain dull to let @entity29 to the nomination without a proper challenge . nevertheless , there is a strange contradiction between the constant assertions that @entity5 want a race and the polling evidence that @entity2 would beat anyone who tried to take her on . why do liberals demand a conversation about policy if the only answer they can still come up with is @entity1 ? the explanation is that the @entity5 is intellectually impoverished . we hear often of the @entity3 \\'s problems , how out of touch with a changing electorate it is and how it is divided against itself . the @entity5 \\' challenges , however , are just as substantial . they \\'ve just been masked by having a charismatic man in the @entity9 dominating the national conversation . @entity14 was elected at one of the highest points of national @entity5 popularity . but , since then , @entity5 power has been whittled away in successive congressional and local elections -- leaving the party without significant representation in the @entity30 and absent any mildly conservative support at all . everything was staked on @entity31 , which was ambitious and noble venture but without an obvious second act to follow . @entity5 have become about defending the honor and reputation of their president rather than proposing bold new reforms . and the mood of their base can be felt either in the violence in @entity17 or the disaffected , hollow laughter of \" @entity32 \" audience . cynicism abounds . who really imagines that @entity1 is the kind of personality that can spark a renaissance of thinking or a rejuvenation of activism among liberals ? to repeat the question : what is she exactly running for ? if she has one trump card to play , however , it is reinvention . recall that she started the 2008 primaries out as a moderate , play - it - safe frontrunner and ended them drinking beer in an @entity33 bar -- reinvented , in the words of @entity14 , as @entity34 . if there is little intellectualism left in liberalism , at least @entity1 is clever . which is why she remains an asset to her party .',\n",
       "  '@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) as aides politely tried to rush @entity3 from an event in @entity0 to one in @entity4 , @entity1 , on thursday , the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him . finally , after the selfies and conversations started to die down , his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall , burly man stopped him . \" senator , \" he said , \" can i pray with you real quick ? \" \" yeah , \" @entity3 said , as he clasped the man \\'s upper arm and the two bowed their heads . it was one of the many moments when @entity3 connected with voters on a religious level last week , as the senator from @entity5 hit the trail in @entity1 for the first time as a presidential candidate . being the only official contender in the race , @entity3 drew large crowds during his two - day swing across the state . he \\'s counting on @entity1 , known for its vocal and active evangelical base , to propel him forward in what \\'s expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of @entity6 candidates . @entity3 , himself , displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room . the senator regularly avoids using a podium , instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone , a scene reminiscent of a sunday morning sermon . when he meets with people after events , he embraces each one \\'s hand with both of his , softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing @entity7 and their pastors . the past two winners of @entity1 \\'s caucuses rose to victory with support from the @entity7 right , and @entity3 , who announced his bid last month at the well - known baptist school @entity8 , is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize . evangelicals make up a large segment of @entity1 \\'s @entity6 voter bloc . according to a @entity9 / @entity10 poll from january , 44 % of likely 2016 @entity6 caucus - goers said they were born - again or evangelical @entity7 . @entity3 has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck @entity6 leadership on fiscal issues , but he showed in @entity1 last week that he \\'s also eager to champion social issues at a time when many @entity6 are anxious to avoid them . he was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in @entity11 , which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians . he described the outrage over the laws as \" shameful \" and an \" assault \" on first amendment rights . \" there are a lot of people here in @entity1 and across the country whose hearts are breaking , watching what has happened in the last two weeks , \" @entity3 said friday night at an event in @entity9 . \" we have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty . \" related : @entity6 2016 hopefuls back @entity11 \\'s \\' religious freedom \\' law he \\'s more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a @entity7 and a pastor . @entity12 , who \\'s become a celebrity among @entity7 conservatives , will frequently visit @entity1 over the next year , @entity3 told voters . and @entity3 \\'s @entity1 director , @entity13 , is a former pastor . @entity3 \\'s first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on @entity14 and @entity15 that are pegged to @entity16 . in the ad , @entity3 talks about the impact of the \" transformative love of @entity17 \" on his life . while neither @entity18 , who won @entity1 in 2008 , nor @entity19 , who won in 2012 , went on to win the nomination , their successes helped launch them into high - profile battles with the then - front - runners . and with both of them likely running again in 2016 , the competition will be stiff . that \\'s why , for @entity3 , courting evangelicals is only a component of a three - pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the @entity20 faction and competing for the libertarian base . his stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction . he received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the @entity21 , and , in a knock against the @entity22 , he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so president @entity23 \" can hear every word i have to say . \" @entity3 argued thursday that the @entity6 needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the @entity24 - @entity25 faction of the party -- young libertarian - minded voters -- and the @entity19 base -- evangelicals . the two blocs , he said , are \" not necessarily the best of chums . \" \" if we \\'re going to win , we \\'ve got to bring that coalition together , \" he said in @entity0 . \" and i think we can do that . \" @entity3 frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels , when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election , a higher than normal turnout for the demographic . that number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it \\'s not too far off from the 56 % of the overall population that voted in 2012 . still , his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who \\'ve been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform , then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls . \" if you look at available places for the party to expand the vote , it does n\\'t exist in the middle , it exists in the evangelical vote , \" said @entity26 , a top @entity3 adviser . \" it is n\\'t a pond , it \\'s an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative . \" @entity27 , president of the @entity28 of the @entity29 , said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says . @entity27 points to hot - button topics like religious freedom issues in the @entity30 , as well as increased attention to the killing of minority @entity31 and rising anti-semitism . \" i do n\\'t think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith , \" @entity27 said . \" i think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good . \" later in april , voters in @entity1 will see the bulk of the @entity6 field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the @entity32 . while the past two winners of the @entity1 caucuses -- @entity19 and @entity18 -- are likely running for president again , @entity33 , president of the group , argued that the field is wide open in terms of who \\'s going to win favor among evangelicals . @entity34 , while not popular among conservative activists , was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as @entity35 governor and touts his catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views . @entity36 is the son of a pastor . @entity37 , the former neurosurgeon , rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the @entity23 administration at a national prayer breakfast . and other likely candidates -- from @entity38 to @entity39 to @entity25 -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right . \" it \\'s up for grabs . it \\'s a clean slate regardless of if you \\'ve run before , \" @entity33 said . \" naturally those two ( @entity18 and @entity19 ) have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past , but by and large voters are going to say , \\' let me take a good look at all of these candidates . \\' \"',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 is coming to @entity2 . in the next few weeks the @entity3 ( @entity3 ) will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department , which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination . it should not be forgotten that the @entity3 review of the @entity4 was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of @entity5 by a @entity2 police officer and by revelations about the town \\'s dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups . now , after a half year of unrest , and with citizens on tuesday electing two new black city council members , change is beginning to come to @entity2 . the question is , what kind of change ? the report from the @entity3 offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens . through illegal traffic stops and arrests , and the use of excessive force , the police department held town residents in bondage . the municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time . court costs and fees constituted the second - largest sources of revenue for the town . rather than a force for public safety , the @entity4 became , according to attorney general @entity6 , \" a collection agency \" -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town \\'s @entity7 residents . the evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating . it included blatantly racist emails traded among officers , and evidence that african - americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department . but just a few weeks before the release of the report , the @entity2 police chief declared there were \" no racial issues \" in his department . @entity2 \\'s ugly , racist emails released the recommendations in the report , ranging from new training and supervision of police officers , addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system , will , if implemented , remake the law enforcement system in the town . ( a grand jury that investigated the shooting of @entity5 by officer @entity8 chose not to file charges against him and the @entity3 also did n\\'t find reason to prosecute . ) without question , change is coming to the town \\'s government . town manager @entity9 , @entity2 \\'s most powerful official and , until the @entity3 \\'s blistering report , the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny , resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city \\'s deputy manager . three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and , on tuesday , citizens elected two black candidates to the city council , changing its racial composition : five of six members and the mayor were white . now the council will be 50 % black . @entity2 \\'s hapless police chief @entity10 also finally resigned after holding on through a months - long display of astonishing incompetence . the department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests . the appointment of a commander from the @entity11 was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest . @entity10 \\'s departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command . and so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council , there will be a new police chief in @entity2 . but does that mean that fundamental change will come to @entity2 ? not necessarily . not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks . the @entity3 \\'s full - on negotiations with the leadership in @entity2 will determine the shape of the new @entity4 . indeed , the @entity3 report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with @entity12 . many local activists have suggested just such a solution , but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in @entity2 last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the @entity3 can fold @entity13 into its monitoring and reform process . equally important were the april 7 general elections . turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in @entity2 , with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than african - americans . but local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get - out - the - vote campaigns . . the mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign ( although a petition for his recall has been circulating ) . that means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the @entity3 to remake the police department . has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks ? community activists and residents must ensure that mayor @entity14 plans to represent their vision of new @entity4 . but there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in @entity2 and throughout @entity12 . @entity2 \\'s governing structure , with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor , mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the @entity15 . that form of governance might have been precisely what thriving , middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like @entity13 . but working class suburbs like @entity2 with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents , may need a more robust form of governance . in any case , a system in which the elected officials have minimal power , but non-elected leaders , like the town manager and the chief of police , have inordinate power , is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable , non-representative government that controlled @entity2 \\'s residents . yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country . likewise , @entity16 , like the vast majority of states , holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years , guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in march and april as @entity16 law requires @entity2 to do . it \\'s not that @entity2 is so different than towns across @entity15 . it \\'s precisely because @entity2 holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high . @entity2 residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in @entity12 plagued by similar governance flaws , including those towns led by @entity7 . and @entity2 \\'s example should provoke self - examination in working class suburbs across the country , where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population . @entity1 is coming to @entity2 . but the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents , whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical @entity7 town .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) for 12 years @entity1 felt worthless , frightened and alone , never knowing when her abusive husband would strike . but as a young mother in rural @entity2 with three children and barely a third grade education , she thought there was no way out . what began as psychological torment , name - calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe @entity1 feared for her life . one day , two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her . they probably would have succeeded , but after the first bullet was fired , @entity1 \\' two sons dragged her inside . still , in her deeply conservative community , it took neighbors two hours to call for help and @entity1 lost her arm . but the abuse did n\\'t stop there . when she returned home , @entity1 \\' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left . that \\'s when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began . @entity1 \\' case is dramatic , but in @entity2 , where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed , it \\'s hardly unusual . a 2012 @entity3 says gender - based violence is at epidemic levels in @entity2 and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide . according to the @entity4 , two women are killed there every day . there are many reasons why , beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country \\'s 36 - year - old civil war . during the conflict , atrocities were committed against women , who were used as a weapon of war . in 1996 , a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government . but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror , due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination . military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions . many remain in power , and they have not changed the way they view women . some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades - long conflict , most of them from indigenous @entity5 populations . nearly 20 years later , according to the @entity6 , levels of violent crime are higher in @entity2 than they were during the war . but despite the high homicide rate , the @entity4 estimates 98 % of cases never make it to court . women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep - rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny . in many cases , femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war , including rape , torture and mutilation . @entity7 drug cartels , organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness . authorities investigating drug - related killings are stretched thin , leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides . in many cases , crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation . many consider the @entity8 , or @entity9 , corrupt , under - resourced and ineffective . even if a case does get prosecuted , according to @entity10 , the country \\'s weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence . perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in @entity2 is the country \\'s deeply rooted patriarchal society . according to @entity11 , the representative of @entity4 women in @entity2 , \" 80 % of men believe that women need permission to leave the house , and 70 % of women surveyed agreed . \" this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence . rights groups say machismo not only condones violence , it places the blame on the victim . the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize . \" politicians do n\\'t think women are important , \" says former secretary general of the @entity12 for women @entity13 . \" political parties use women for elections . they give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor . \" lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty . many girls , especially in indigenous communities do n\\'t go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far . @entity13 says \" they are subject to rape , violence and forced participation in the drug trade . \" although the situation for girls and women in @entity2 is alarming , there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing . with the help of an organization known as @entity14 , or @entity15 , @entity1 was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved . he is now spending 27 years behind bars . @entity1 is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art. since 2008 , she and four other abuse survivors known as @entity16 , or \" @entity17 , \" have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories . the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly , but it also offers suggestions for change . and it \\'s having an impact . women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support . men are reacting , too . one of the main characters , @entity18 , says during one presentation , a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated . he said he wanted to be different . the taboo topic of gender - based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of @entity2 \\'s most vulnerable groups , indigenous @entity5 girls . in 2004 , with help from the @entity4 and other organizations , the @entity19 launched a community - based club known as @entity20 , or \" @entity21 \" . the goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential . senior program coordinator @entity22 says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves . \" they then share this information with their mothers and for the first time , they realize they are entitled to certain rights . \" @entity22 adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence . the @entity2 government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women . in 2008 , the @entity23 passed a law against femicide . two years later the attorney general \\'s office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women . in 2012 , the government established a joint task force for crimes against women , making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need . the government has also established a special 24 - hour court to attend to femicide cases . on the global front , the @entity24 was introduced in the @entity23 in 2007 ; it has been pending ever since . but last week the act was reintroduced in both the @entity25 and @entity26 . if approved , it would make reducing levels of gender - based violence a @entity27 foreign policy priority . pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from international nongovernmental organizations , which are on the front lines of the fight against gender - based discrimination in @entity2 . @entity28 , a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group @entity29 , says , \" we work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence . our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models , and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women . \" but the job is far from over . while there is tempered optimism and hope for change , the problem of gender - based violence in @entity2 is one that needs international attention and immediate action . @entity1 is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors , which has allowed her to move forward . but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures . for them , it \\'s a race against time and help can not come soon enough .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 , my @entity2 senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president . he noted at his announcement ( with a familiar note of wise irony ) : \" people should not underestimate me . \" to most @entity3 , of course , sen. @entity1 is only a name , if that . he is barely known to the general public , which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation . those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left - wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the @entity4 , as we did in 2006 . let me add this , as someone who has followed him closely ( and with admiration ) for a long time : when people stop to listen to @entity1 , they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is , without a question , an authentic voice who speaks without fear . and nobody should underestimate him . i remember when @entity1 was mayor of @entity5 ; it is the largest city in @entity2 ( which is n\\'t saying much ) . i met him then , and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before . he spoke with a throaty @entity6 accent , and he was @entity7 -- not your typical @entity8 . he served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of @entity9 with remarkable energy for many years , listening closely to what people had to say , learning about politics at the local level , making a real difference in the daily lives of hard - working people . he was never a @entity10 -- and is n\\'t yet . he \\'s a progressive , holding his seat in the @entity4 as an independent , although he votes with the @entity11 on major issues . when @entity1 decided to run for @entity12 \\' seat in the @entity13 in 1988 , many considered him a long shot . i remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse , where @entity1 held the floor for almost two hours , answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce , funny , entertaining , passionate voice . @entity1 won that seat , again and again . make no mistake about this : @entity2 is n\\'t just a rainbow - colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets . it \\'s an agricultural economy , and @entity1 has understood this well . he has thoughtfully supported @entity2 \\'s dairy - farming community over many years . he has also been a strong supporter of @entity2 \\'s hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left , who wonder why the @entity14 does n\\'t attack him . i was never prouder of @entity1 than during the run - up to the invasion of @entity15 . he was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the @entity13 , strongly opposing the 2003 invasion . he saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in @entity3 history , one with endless repercussions . he was especially outraged by the outing of former @entity16 spy @entity17 in 2006 by an official from the @entity18 , and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the @entity19 in the first place . this was typical of @entity1 : the clear voice in the midst of the crowd , the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudly . so what would it look like if , by some bizarre chance , @entity1 caught fire and became president ? he would certainly work hard for universal health care , which has been a passion of his . i \\'ve heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system -- the single - payer system -- that has worked well throughout @entity20 for decades , reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well . he would not be @entity21 \\'s best friend . indeed , he did n\\'t support president @entity22 in his efforts to bail out the bankers , and wrote an open letter to @entity23 , the @entity3 secretary of the treasury , protesting that bailout . famously , on december 10 , 2010 , he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the @entity4 opposing the reinstatement of bush - era tax cuts , a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand @entity1 \\'s views . he is a socialist , of course . how many @entity3 politicians have ever said this aloud ? and what does he really mean by that term ? @entity1 knows what he \\'s doing . by proclaiming himself a socialist , he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks , many with international bases , have controlled @entity3 public policy for a very long time , usually to the detriment of working people . and it \\'s working people who seem mostly to interest @entity1 . he has been one of only a few voices in the @entity4 in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right - wing factions funded by \" millionaires and billionaires \" ( one of @entity1 \\'s favorite mantras ) have held sway over @entity3 politics for as long as anyone can recall . and this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads , serve meals , deliver the mail , drive trucks and teach in schools . as president , @entity1 would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change . indeed , @entity1 co-sponsored with @entity24 the @entity25 of 2007 . he has , for years , been a tireless advocate for the environment , aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad . but does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the @entity11 nomination ? and if he won it , could he defeat a @entity26 candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal ? he \\'s not crazy . in fact , he \\'s probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes . but he ca n\\'t win , and he knows that . what he will do , however , is move @entity27 on matters of importance to progressives : the restraining of @entity21 and large corporations , the scandal of how @entity3 allows its political campaigns to be funded and the welfare of working class @entity3 , who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests . a steep climb looms before him . but i applaud @entity1 . i hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard .',\n",

( there have been ) significant gains against @entity4 -- particularly in @entity8 -- and it \\'s no coincidence we \\'ve seen isis make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in @entity9 . it \\'s asymmetric warfare , they know they can not hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw ... then take initiative elsewhere . they have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere . it continues their image of initiative , of shocking , of reshaping the world -- which is what they are trying to do . @entity1 : what does the map tell us about the coalition \\'s strategy ? @entity10 : it \\'s very telling . there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the @entity3 forces . it \\'s a push against the front line of @entity4 rather than being brave and creative and going in behind @entity4 \\'s lines and breaking it up . what this is n\\'t is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push . the capability you need ( for this kind of warfare ) is much more high - tech than the capabilities the @entity3 have . those capabilities are available in the region -- @entity11 , @entity12 and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it \\'s very interesting that the @entity13 nations have not developed an effective coalition to target @entity4 which is an existential threat . @entity1 : what about @entity14 ? @entity4 seems to be winning there . @entity10 : @entity14 has been a potential battlefield for the past decade . but in this context ( @entity4 ) will ... be pushing in @entity14 because that \\'s an area they have lots of support . it also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains . the concept of success is hugely important to them -- it \\'s what sustains the recruitment effort of @entity4 . nobody wants to join a bunch of losers , so it \\'s very important for them to be seen to be succeeding . above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media . they are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in @entity15 and killing refugees in camps like @entity16 . but where it counts they are not standing and fighting .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) the new emojis are here ! on thursday , @entity1 released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race , ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just wo n\\'t cut it . the reaction to this new lineup is , as should be expected with almost anything new in today \\'s hypersensitive climate , a range of cheers and jeers . why is any of this important , you may ask ? for many , these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting . rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity , sexual orientation , race or even hair color is part of mainstream @entity2 -- despite what others might say . this matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day . think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling . or more accurately , think of a white face smiling because up until thursday \\'s update , all the emojis had pale skin . but that has all changed . now there \\'s a range of emoji skin tones to pick from , including yellow , brown and black . i \\'m sure few people will be upset with this development . but how about in december ? why ? now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji , and that will also include ... @entity3 . that shrieking sound you may have heard was from @entity4 \\' @entity5 , who famously stated in 2013 that @entity3 is absolutely , definitely and without a doubt a white guy . in fact , thanks to @entity1 , we may even see @entity6 emojis this december . ( could that mean he \\'s a @entity7 ? ! @entity8 even more shrieking from @entity4 . ) there is more . @entity1 has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis , kissing with a heart over their heads . this inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on @entity9 . it \\'s not yet clear if a person who likes to use same - sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of \" religious liberty . \" but it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 @entity10 presidential candidates might have to say about \" gay emojis . \" and i would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay . the fact is , when you embrace diversity , you will still leave out other minority groups . redheads , for example , are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color . in fact , supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures . even expanding the flags represented by emojis , as @entity1 has done , comes at some peril . apparently @entity11 is overjoyed that finally @entity1 has included it . but @entity12 are not happy they were left out . i must admit that being partially of @entity13 heritage , it \\'s heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a @entity13 state , @entity1 has chosen to now include a @entity13 flag emoji . @entity12 , i feel your pain . of course the bigger question in the whole diverse - emoji issue is : what took @entity1 so long ? how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from ? that the company ( finally ) did is a step in the right direction : @entity2 \\'s demographics are changing , so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this . @entity1 has \" evolved \" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same - sex couples . maybe \" religious liberty \" conservatives who discriminate will follow .',\n",

@entity12 : we focus on day - to - day support -- financial assistance , housecleaning , prepared meals , supplies for the home , kids \\' events . it \\'s that old - fashioned mentality of neighbors helping neighbors . who does n\\'t like a clean house that they did n\\'t have to clean themselves ? we have a team of volunteers that have all been background - checked and they sweep , mop , clean the bathrooms . we even have a couple of volunteers who go way above and beyond and will do laundry and fold clothes . and so , our parents can come home from chemo , sit on the couch and read a book with their child without having to worry about , \" ugh , the bathroom needs to be cleaned . \" it \\'s just to allow them to focus on what \\'s important , which is their health and their family . @entity2 : is this work hard for you sometimes , on a personal level ? @entity12 : about 80 % of the parents we support are stage 4 , which means that battling cancer is their full - time job . they will not go back to work and for the rest of their lives , they \\'ll be in treatment . it \\'s hard . it \\'s a rollercoaster . i \\'ve had bouts when a certain mom has passed where i did n\\'t get out of bed for two weeks . and i thought , \" why am i doing this ? \" but then i come back and remember why . and so , while @entity13 is and always will be our inspiration , there are now so many others that are just as inspirational . they \\'re why i keep doing what i do . @entity2 : we should note that name of the organization is no longer entirely accurate . @entity12 : we \\'re not just about moms -- we have dads , too ! not a lot , but if you are a single parent , you need the support . they tend to even get a little special treatment . everybody \\'s like , \" oh , there \\'s a dad here . \" and so they give them lots of hugs and pay a lot of attention to them . @entity2 : it \\'s such a serious subject , but your group seems to have a very fun vibe . @entity12 : we \\'re very social ! once a month , all of our families come to pick up their supplies . we do crafts with the kids , snacks and have a good time . we like having any event because cancer sucks , and there \\'s not a lot of happy that goes with that . but life does still go on , so it \\'s really important that these families can just de-stress and have fun . no one can understand what they \\'re going through like another single parent with cancer . so giving them the opportunity to meet and support each other is very powerful . cancer can be so defeating . it \\'s an ugly word and it \\'s a sad word . and so , it \\'s my hope that @entity6 can bring joy and say to cancer , \" you ca n\\'t defeat us . we are still going to be strong and we \\'re going to celebrate life . and you ca n\\'t take that away from us . \" want to get involved ?

\" what a great , great witness for the prosecution , \" @entity0 legal analyst @entity8 said . \" basically what happened is @entity2 lied to his boss . and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand . \" when questioned by a defense attorney , @entity7 said that he \\'d never had any problems with @entity2 and that the player was always respectful to him . @entity2 \\'s fiancee , @entity9 , revealed for the first time last week that @entity2 told her to dispose of a box from the couple \\'s home that she said reeked of marijuana . she also said she did n\\'t know what was in the box . that revelation may contradict the prosecution \\'s contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box . the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered . during cross-examination by the defense , @entity9 testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled \" skunky . \" earlier , she told prosecutors during direct examination that she did n\\'t know what was in the box . she said @entity2 never told her , and she never looked . after concealing the box with her daughter \\'s clothing , @entity9 said she threw it away in \" a random dumpster \" but could not remember exactly where . much testimony has focused on the shoes @entity2 wore the night @entity3 was shot . a @entity10 consultant testified that @entity2 was wearing @entity11 @entity12 . about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13 . the shoe \\'s sole makes a distinct impression , said lt. @entity13 of the @entity14 . the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney @entity15 that other @entity10 shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression . yet @entity13 , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footprint left near @entity3 \\'s body was \" in agreement \" or consistent with the @entity16 @entity12 size 13 . although he did not have the shoes that @entity2 wore that night , he used an identical pair to make his determination . @entity13 did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression . jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression . what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney @entity15 . @entity15 questioned the science behind analyzing footprints . he introduced a march 2014 investigative report written by @entity13 saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison . prosecutors used grainy footage from @entity2 \\'s home security system to suggest he was holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill @entity3 . @entity2 could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after @entity3 was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from @entity2 \\'s home . \" in my opinion , the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol , \" @entity17 sales manager @entity18 testified . the video is time - stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say @entity3 was gunned down after getting out of a car @entity2 was driving . @entity2 \\'s lawyers then showed a different part of the video time - stamped a few seconds earlier with @entity2 holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an @entity19 . \" glock pistols do n\\'t have white glows to them , do they ?

prosecutors have said @entity3 might have done or said something that did n\\'t sit well with @entity2 . they claimed @entity2 rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score . @entity2 \\'s co-defendants , @entity21 and @entity22 , also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . but the case gets more complicated . evidence collected in @entity3 \\'s death investigation led to two more murder charges against @entity2 in a separate case in @entity23 . @entity2 is also accused of shooting @entity24 and @entity25 , allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub . that double shooting took place in july 2012 , almost a year before @entity3 was killed . prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that @entity2 may have been mad at himself for possibly showing @entity3 the spot where that double murder happened . during trial , prosecutors suggest a text written by @entity2 the day before the murder saying he was \" buggin \" for showing @entity3 \" the spot \" may have played a role in plotting to kill @entity3 . the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in @entity3 \\'s trial , ruling it is prejudicial . @entity2 has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well . but when the @entity3 trial ends , that murder trial awaits him . @entity0 \\'s @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 contributed to this report .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) the other day , i searched through hundreds of photos hoping to find a starting point to write this article . looking through old photos is usually an enjoyable experience -- coming across a wedding or remembrances of happy times with family and friends . on this occasion , however , i found myself flipping through images from a devastating time we dearly wish had never happened but can not afford to forget . white sand beaches stained with black sludge , oil - choked waterways and wildlife , shuttered businesses , and front - lawn signs pleading for justice and help . five years after the @entity1 oil rig disaster that killed 11 people , devastated livelihoods and wreaked havoc on the already fragile natural resources of the @entity2 region , it \\'s time to ask ourselves : what have we learned ? and what are we willing to do make sure it does n\\'t happen again ? i spent much of 2010 in the @entity2 , traveling through the communities , spending time with the people and witnessing the impact of this environmental catastrophe . five years later , i returned to see what has changed and what has remained the same . first , it \\'s important to understand that the principle \" out of sight , out of mind \" does n\\'t apply in the communities of @entity3 states . the @entity4 oil spill \\'s legacy continues to haunt this region like a recurring cancer . on this most recent trip , i saw the ghostly remains of entire islands virtually swallowed up by the oil , and i learned about oystermen and fishermen whose livelihoods are still crippled by what happened five years ago . imagining @entity5 : a rig worker \\'s daughter and her dreams of course , that \\'s not to say progress has n\\'t been made . community groups and dedicated organizations have worked ceaselessly to restore and repair not only the physical environment , but also the way of life . this work is critical , and it deserves our attention and additional resources to continue to progress . but make no mistake : though a kind of normalcy has returned to the @entity2 region and important progress has been made , the oil is still there . what we do and do n\\'t know about the oil spill a recent study from @entity6 estimates that up to 10 million gallons of that oil is still on the seafloor of the @entity2 . ( @entity4 disputes the study ) . everything is not \" back to normal . \" so far , @entity4 has spent more than $ 14 billion on cleanup , and despite its assurances that everything is recovering , we witnessed a crew on a beach in @entity7 ( off @entity8 ) digging up oily sand . not what i would call recovered . and while this kind of reflection is rarely pleasant , it is critical in order to avoid another tragedy on the scale of the @entity4 spill , or potentially much worse . it \\'s important to note that for areas like the @entity2 , which are already affected by drilling , many of the common - sense safety reforms called for by the @entity9 on the oil spill in january 2011 have yet to be implemented . and yet , early this year , the @entity10 administration proposed a five - year offshore oil and gas drilling plan that , in addition to new areas in the @entity2 , would open the southeast @entity11 from @entity12 to @entity13 , as well as the majority of the wild @entity14 to offshore oil and gas drilling . in the case of the @entity14 , one of the last pristine ocean habitats , oil companies have to admit that they are n\\'t prepared to safeguard against the disasters that may take place if the plan is allowed to move forward . imagine what would happen if an oil spill occurred in a region where what little technology we have , like oil booms and controlled burns , is useless in the land of floating icebergs and catastrophic storms . in the case of the @entity15 , the increase in severe storms and rise in sea level , as well as what is at stake from an ecological standpoint , do n\\'t paint a more optimistic picture . we have a simple choice : do we continue to make the same mistakes with a \" business as usual \" approach , or do we change the way we manage and use the resources the @entity16 provides us ? i \\'m not saying the path forward is easy . it \\'s not , but this is a challenge we need to embrace . some solutions are relatively straightforward -- holding industry and our government responsible for human and environmental safety is certainly at the top of this list . taking the time and effort to understand our natural resources before we exploit them is another . despite its importance to navigation , fishing , oil and gas development , and maritime safety , our understanding of how the @entity2 system works remains extremely limited . independent research free of corporate and government influence in the @entity2 is critical . projects like habitat mapping can result in countless ecological and economic benefits , such as improved assessments of fishery health , a baseline for tracking success of billions of dollars in restoration efforts , an essential foundation for modeling and monitoring the @entity2 ecosystem , and a planning tool for better managing one of the hardest - working bodies of water in the world . and , perhaps our biggest and most important challenge : we must continue to eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels by developing sustainable energy solutions , including solar and wind power , and the sustainable jobs and opportunities that follow the kind of pioneering innovation that makes @entity17 such a great country . not long after the spill began , i was speaking to a group of elementary school students with my environmental education nonprofit @entity18 . the students were all horrified and upset by what was happening in the @entity2 . at the end of a question - and - answer session , i asked them , \" who is going to clean up this mess ? \" all of them raised their hands and said in somewhat subdued unison , \" we will . \" i \\'ve told this story in the intervening years , and it \\'s always given me a sense of hope . thinking of those young children now also steels my resolve to make sure they do n\\'t have to deliver on that promise . the following local and national coalitions and organizations offer great starting points to become involved in the movement to restore the @entity2 and its communities , and to make sure we take steps to prevent history from repeating itself : the @entity19 , @entity20 , the @entity21 and the @entity22 .',\n",

fair question . but for better or worse , mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that \\'s where most campaign dollars go . both sides know how to play , sometimes brilliantly . remember the @entity23 advertisements of 1984 , proclaiming \" @entity24 \" ?

what if there was no witness -- or hero , as i call him -- to come forward ? \" said @entity10 @entity11 , an attorney for @entity2 \\'s family . \" as you can see , the initial ( police ) reports stated something totally different . \" that \\'s putting it mildly . in early police statements -- issued before the video came to light -- @entity1 reportedly said that @entity2 attacked him , that he fired only after a scuffle and that cops made medical efforts to revive @entity2 . the video makes hash of those claims , and likely contributed to @entity1 \\'s swift arrest and pending murder charges . \" when you \\'re wrong , you \\'re wrong , \" said @entity3 mayor @entity12 . that leaves @entity1 to face murder charges that could land him on death row -- and the rest of us to face a disturbing reality . i \\'m all for having police use body cameras , although they are not a magic cure for preventing or stopping the excessive use of force . but the much bigger problem is that we simply do n\\'t know when and where police killings take place , or whether they cluster in particular cities or states . and that means we do n\\'t know for certain whether unjustified or excessive force correlates with particular forms of officer training or detectable underlying racial bias . we do n\\'t even know the role played by officers operating under stressful conditions or while dealing with mental or physical illness . these vital questions are n\\'t supposed to be a mystery . according to @entity13 of the @entity14 , \" the attorney general shall , through appropriate means , acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers . ... the attorney general shall publish an annual summary of the data acquired under this section . \" that section of the law has effectively been ignored , beyond a first attempt at a comprehensive report published in 1996 . by 2001 , a @entity15 article noted that when it comes to police uses of deadly force , \" no comprehensive accounting for all of the nation \\'s 17,000 police department exists . \" there are multiple reasons the law has been ignored . collecting information from the nation \\'s thousands of jurisdictions -- the myriad villages , counties and cities -- is a tough , expensive assignment . the job is even harder because many police departments , reluctant to air their dirty laundry , fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that it \\'s up to the courts to rule on whether an officer has committed brutality -- something that \\'s often established only after years of court proceedings . these hurdles could be overcome by a determined effort from @entity16 , but @entity5 has failed to press the @entity8 to demand the data and comply with the 1994 law . a weak substitute called the @entity17 in @entity18 was passed in 2000 and renewed in 2014 , but it is a voluntary reporting program intended to coax information out of local departments . some of the data gap has been filled by media organizations -- and what they have discovered only underscores the need for muscular , mandatory enforcement of the data - gathering law . in 2011 , the @entity19 published an extensive investigation of police killings in and around @entity19 and found 378 shootings over a 20 - year period , 142 of which were fatal . in no case was an officer convicted or even fired because of an on - duty shooting . in @entity4 last month , @entity20 newspaper published an examination of 209 instances in which officers shot at suspects , and found that only a handful of officers were charged , and none found guilty . \" in @entity4 , it remains exceedingly rare for an officer to be found at fault criminally for shooting at someone , \" the @entity21 newspaper concluded . a group of activists has created a website called @entity22 that flags cases of police killings ; its estimate that at least 304 black people were killed by police in 2014 may stand as the best guess we have about the dimensions of a national problem . but we should n\\'t be guessing . as the @entity19 editorialized in 2011 : \" how many lives might be saved if taxpayers everywhere were better informed about police shootings ? how can they know about a potential local problem without information ? ... police already track everything from domestic violence to child abuse to murder , and police routinely lobby state and federal lawmakers to put new crimes into statute . the budgetary impact of adding another reporting category to local police forces would be minuscule . the social impact of such an addition , however , would be huge . \" that common - sense observation is being echoed by the @entity23 administration -- specifically , the president \\'s @entity24 on @entity25 , created in december in response to widespread protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including @entity26 and @entity27 . the recently released interim report of the task force calls , one more time , for the @entity8 to collect comprehensive data from local departments . but it will take more pressure -- from activists , victims \\' families , members of @entity5 and president @entity23 himself -- to demand an end to the stonewalling of information . it \\'s long past time we got to the truth of how many more killings like @entity2 \\'s are happening without a video to set the record straight .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) in baseball , there \\'s a traditional comeback after a tough season : \" wait \\' til next year ! \" for climate change \" next year \" is now . this year is the time and the @entity1 \\' international climate negotiations in @entity2 in december are the place to secure strong global agreement to curb heat - trapping emissions . a successful climate pact will send a signal around the world that a shift to a low - carbon economy is underway . the @entity3 has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change . the @entity3 administration on tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce @entity3 greenhouse gas emissions by 26 % to 28 % below 2005 levels by 2025 . this common - sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the @entity3 economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more @entity3 energy jobs to power our homes and businesses . this is an area where the @entity3 needs to lead , and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country . the @entity3 is n\\'t alone in this global climate effort . in a landmark joint announcement with the @entity3 in november , @entity4 unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero - carbon energy to 20 % . this shift will require substantial effort from @entity4 to retool its economy , increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal . as the world \\'s no. 1 investor in renewable energy , @entity4 has already taken important steps forward . at the same time , @entity5 has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022 , a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the @entity3 has today . cities and corporations are joining in as well . more than 200 cities , home to 436 million people , have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury . and more than a thousand companies , along with 73 countries , voiced support for putting a price on carbon and moving to cleaner energy technologies . leading companies , like @entity6 and @entity7 , are making major bets on renewable energy . and another 25 businesses have signed onto the @entity8 \\' principles — these companies represent energy demand equal to more than 1 million homes . increasing examples demonstrate that strong climate action can be good for the economy . for instance , renewable sources now provide one - fifth of the world \\'s electricity , while solar manufacturing costs have dropped 80 % in the last seven years . wind turbines installed now are 100 times better at generating power than turbines were 30 years ago . clean technology investments surged to $ 310 billion last year . in the @entity3 , carbon emissions fell by 10 % from 2007 to 2013 , the largest absolute emissions reduction recorded , even as the @entity3 has recovered from the @entity9 . many of these shifts are unprecedented and could not have been anticipated even five years ago . yet these trends alone are not enough to counter the mounting climate - related impacts that we are already seeing . a global climate agreement in @entity2 this december can send more signals to markets and drive more ambitious climate action for decades to come . a @entity2 agreement would represent a new form of international cooperation and a fundamental change in the global approach to climate action — a shift from burden - sharing to the creation of mutual opportunities ; from cost to investment ; from economic threat to a spur to economic development . with the @entity3 showing the way , and with cooperation from other countries , businesses , investors , cities and citizens , we can achieve a prosperous and secure future for all . each year , baseball returns and hope springs eternal . now , it \\'s time for all countries to get in the game .',\n",

first failed @entity4 bid , @entity5 will once again seek the @entity6 \\'s nomination for president . \" i \\'m hitting the road to earn your vote , because it \\'s your time , \" @entity5 said in a video released sunday afternoon officially kicking off her campaign . \" and i hope you \\'ll join me on this journey . \" as @entity5 sets off onto the campaign trail to reintroduce herself to voters and court donors across the country , @entity2 elites are ready to roll out the red carpet . but while the enthusiastic support from the industry will be a financial boon for @entity5 \\'s newly launched campaign , it will also pose a delicate balancing act when it comes to appeasing a vocal wing of her party that is antagonistic toward the banking sector . @entity5 , 67 , has long enjoyed a close relationship with the financial industry . as a @entity0 senator for almost a decade , she represented @entity2 and courted the industry aggressively during her last presidential campaign . and there is a certain degree of nostalgia within the industry for her husband \\'s two - term presidency , marked by the 1990s bull market and broad financial deregulation , including the repeal of the @entity7 , which separated commercial banking from riskier investing activities . now @entity5 \\'s allies in the finance world are eager to galvanize a broad network of potential donors in @entity0 and beyond . many on @entity2 and in the broader business community view her as a dependable , business - friendly force within a @entity6 that has grown increasingly populist during president @entity8 \\'s time in office . @entity9 , the former ceo of @entity10 and a close @entity8 associate who will back @entity5 in 2016 , said there \\'s an \" incredible amount of enthusiasm \" for her campaign to get off the ground . \" we know the secretary from the years of being first lady to the senator to the secretary , so we have decades of working relationship with her , \" @entity9 , who now runs a boutique consulting firm headquartered in @entity11 , told @entity1 . \" i do n\\'t think it \\'s surprising that the former senator of @entity0 is close to the finance community . \" @entity5 friend and prominent @entity6 fundraiser @entity12 , who founded the venture capital firm @entity13 , said @entity5 has \" an enormous following \" both inside and outside of the finance world . \" there are a lot of people who perhaps did n\\'t know her as well before who are all set to jump on the bandwagon , \" @entity12 said . as compared with 2008 , he added : \" there is no diminishment , just the opposite -- an acceleration of interest in her running for the presidency . \" but the fanfare wo n\\'t sit well with everyone . the former first lady \\'s perceived coziness with @entity2 is a source of irritation for liberal activists , who hope to push the eventual @entity6 nominee to embrace progressive ideals during the 2016 primaries . @entity5 , who lost her first presidential campaign to a challenger from the left , seems to recognize that the liberal wing of the party has grown even more vocal and influential since then , especially on economic matters . her video message on sunday centered on the theme of upward mobility and an economic recovery that has left some behind . \" @entity14 have fought their way back from tough economic times , but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top , \" @entity5 said , vowing to be a \" champion \" of \" everyday @entity14 . \" that statement tracks closely with her tone in recent public appearances , where the former secretary has been hitting on populist economic themes . she has taken on a range of issues that most appeal to liberals , such as the wealth gap , minimum wage and equal pay , in the months leading up to her announcement . in january , she took to social media to defend the 2010 @entity15 @entity2 reform law , which contains provisions that the industry has tried to roll back . \" attacking financial reform is risky and wrong , \" she wrote on @entity16 . @entity17 , a longtime @entity5 ally and former @entity8 chief of staff , said @entity5 has to reintroduce herself to the party . if she defends policies viewed as having contributed to the financial crisis , @entity17 said , \" that \\'s a problem . \" he continued : \" my guess is she \\'ll have enough policy positions that says she \\'s not in the tank with them . \" @entity5 \\'s early gestures have not satisfied some activists , who point to @entity18 @entity6 sen. @entity19 as their candidate of choice . several liberal groups have even launched a formal draft campaign to elevate the senator and highlight her progressive views . former @entity20 @entity21 sen. @entity22 , who served as head of the @entity23 , said part of @entity5 \\'s challenge stems from the fact that \" the center of the @entity6 has moved very much to the left . \" \" @entity3 has always been much more rational on these issues and much more mainstream , \" @entity22 said . \" i presume she \\'s going to get the nomination , but she may be contested from the left . \" while @entity24 has shown no interest in running for president this cycle , other democrats have been taking aim at big banks as they tour the early presidential states . former @entity25 gov. @entity26 , former @entity27 sen. @entity28 and @entity29 sen. @entity30 , an independent who caucuses with @entity6 , are all testing the waters . they have made economic populism central to their potential campaigns , proposing to crack down on the banking sector , reform the culture on @entity2 and toughen financial regulations . none of these potential candidates will be able to compete with @entity5 \\'s extensive fundraising apparatus . but their presence in the race could exert pressure on @entity5 to embrace progressive policies . after @entity5 \\'s announcement sunday , a collection of liberal activists declared that the former secretary of state must prove her progressive bona fides. \" we look forward to @entity3 and other candidates laying out their platforms and hearing whether they embrace the fights that sen. @entity24 has spent her life leading , \" said @entity24 campaign manager @entity31 . \" in the coming days , @entity32 will be stepping up our efforts to convince @entity24 to run for president . \" now that she is a formally declared candidate , political strategists expect @entity5 to be more outspoken , laying out her economic priorities quickly and in her own terms . @entity6 strategist @entity33 downplayed the notion of @entity5 - @entity24 tension in the @entity6 , predicting that with @entity5 as an announced candidate , \" she \\'ll offer a pretty compelling rationale \" for her campaign . @entity33 , who worked in @entity34 \\'s administration , said he envisioned an economic message for @entity5 anchored in her biography : \" i grew up in the @entity35 in a middle class family , i understand the challenges that they face , we need to make sure that @entity14 gives people a fair shot . \" despite @entity5 \\'s embrace of more populist rhetoric , finance and business leaders are n\\'t too concerned that she will back policies that are anathema to them . they expect that she will be able to articulate a broad economic goals aimed at the middle class rather than one that rails against bailouts and financial excess , particularly as the country gets more distance from the last financial crisis . @entity36 , president of the @entity37 , a prominent business coalition , predicted that @entity5 would be able to maintain her relationship with @entity2 without alienating the liberal base . the fact that @entity5 \" is knowledgeable and maintains good , open relationships with the business and financial world does not suggest that she \\'s in anybody \\'s pocket , \" @entity36 said . \" she \\'s demonstrated that she \\'s an independent force . \"',\n",

@entity4 relationship . but that \\'s not to say they were glamorous . in fact , the negotiations this week provided a modern demonstration of diplomacy at its best , but also at its most hectic . tucked amid the @entity6 on the shores of @entity7 , @entity0 is certainly one of the more scenic places to be trapped for talks -- a sort of @entity8 for the rich and famous . but make no mistake : the site of these negotiations is also a gilded cage . over the course of the eight - day round of talks , negotiators , their delegations , their security details and reporters were confined primarily to the immediate area around the five - star @entity9 , which played host to the negotiations . this is n\\'t the first time the hotel has provided a backdrop to a major diplomatic event . in 1923 , the @entity10 was signed there , breaking up the @entity11 and defining the borders of modern - day @entity12 . more recently , the hotel has been a getaway for wealthy tourists and the occasional celebrity . @entity13 famously lived there in the late 1940s and early 1950s , and even had her dog buried on the hotel grounds , some reports say . \\' it was tough , very intense at times \\' the setting is idyllic , and the grounds are beautifully maintained . the first - floor terrace even features a large - scale chess board , which served this week as an artful analogy for the game of nuclear chess going on just inside . for the negotiators , the past week was marked by a marathon run of meetings , sometimes lasting throughout the night . in an interview with @entity2 shortly after the framework agreement was announced , secretary of state @entity14 said , \" i think there was a seriousness of purpose \" in meetings with the @entity4 . \" people negotiated hard , \" he added . \" it was tough , very intense at times , sometimes emotional and confrontational . \" that sentiment was echoed by @entity4 foreign minister @entity15 even as the talks were still going on . over the past 18 months since talks began , @entity15 said , negotiators have \" developed personal respect \" for one another , even though serious mistrust still exists between @entity4 and the @entity16 powers . \" we have a very serious problem of confidence -- mutual lack of confidence we need to address -- and we hope that this process will remedy some of that , \" he added . media give - and - take @entity15 made these comments to reporters who swarmed him during an afternoon walk along the lake thursday . such ambushes were a frequent occurrence during the talks as reporters tried to supplement what little information was being circulated through official channels . @entity14 was seen riding a bike on at least one occasion and dining at a nearby crepery on another , with both occasions prompting a cacophony of camera flashes . reporters briefly followed @entity17 foreign minister @entity18 as he took a morning jog shortly after his arrival in @entity0 on sunday . and @entity15 took several lakeside walks with advisers and security personnel , perhaps just hoping to take in the view , but certainly not making any effort to bypass the area where television cameras were staked out around the clock . the officials sometimes bemoaned the media circus , but they also used the attention to bolster their demands during negotiations , making statements to reporters that they hoped strengthened their footing in talks with their foreign counterparts . \" people often use you guys to deliver messages to the negotiation , \" a senior administration official who asked not to be named told reporters on the flight back to @entity0 , \" as do the @entity4 . \" \" i think they \\'re quite skilled , actually , at using the media to deliver messages and to try to shape the frame of the negotiation , \" the official said . different orbits more than 600 reporters were credentialed to cover the talks this week . many of these were based in a large workspace at the nearby @entity19 . meanwhile , the traveling press corps covering the foreign ministers were given coveted red badges , allowing them access to the hotel , where the talks took place . while these journalists had a bit more access to officials , they were usually cordoned off inside a couple of claustrophobic media rooms and barred access to most of the building , including the hotel \\'s reception desk , the first - floor restrooms and the two - @entity20 \\'s entrees , costing 200 francs or more . many journalists found refuge in the more comfortable downstairs bar , a shorter walk from the cameras and satellite trucks used around the clock by television reporters on a rolling deadline . for meals , the crowd dispersed to a dozen or so nearby restaurants , where they could enjoy 25 - franc pizzas and 60 - franc hamburgers , washed down with 8 - franc bottles of water , of course . also popular : a @entity21 place around the corner that offered quick takeout -- a plus for reporters on a deadline . \\' we \\'d all take deep breaths and try again \\' in the closed -

day - long diplomatic event had hit its crescendo before finally subsiding . by midday friday , the delegations had left @entity0 , along with most of the media , returning the scenic @entity6 city to its more tranquil pace .',\n",

lift after some help from fashion designers like these from @entity7 and the @entity8 . the gowns are among the most vexing parts of being in the hospital . but if efforts by some health systems are an indicator , the design may be on its way out of style . the @entity9 was an early trendsetter . in 2010 , it introduced new gowns after being prompted by the ceo , who often heard patient complaints when he was a practicing heart surgeon . that feedback led to a search for something new , said @entity10 , chief experience officer at the hospital system . the prominent academic medical center ultimately sought the help of fashion icon @entity11 , settling on a reversible gown with a front and back v - neck , complete derriere coverage , and features such as pockets , softer fabric and a new bolder print pattern . patients \" loved the gowns , \" @entity10 said . \" people felt much more comfortable in the new design , not just physically but emotionally . \" in recent years , she added , \" hospitals are looking at everything they do and trying to evaluate whether or not it contributes to enhancing the patient experience . \" it \\'s all part of a trend among hospitals to improve the patient reviews and their own bottom lines -- fueled in part by the health law \\'s focus on quality of care and other federal initiatives . the @entity12 increasingly factors patients \\' satisfaction into its quality measures , which are linked to the size of @entity13 payments hospitals get . sometimes the efforts involve large capital improvement projects . but they can also mean making waiting rooms more comfortable , improving the quality of food served to patients or , as in this case , updating hospital gowns . ultimately , this focus leads to \" a better patient experience , \" said @entity14 , senior vice president of the @entity15 . the @entity16 - based @entity17 is in the process of updating its gowns , an initiative that began when the system \\'s innovation institute challenged students at the city \\'s @entity18 to identify and offer a solution to one hospital problem . the students responded with the suggestion to redo the garment that has often been described by patients as flimsy , humiliating , indecent and itchy . the process took three years , but last fall , the institute unveiled a new and improved version . it \\'s made of warmer fabric -- a cotton blend -- that wraps around a patient \\'s body like a robe and comes in navy and light blue , the hospital \\'s signature colors . patient expectations are part of the calculus . they \" are demanding more privacy and more dignity , \" said @entity19 , a product designer at the @entity8 . when the institute tested his gown design , @entity19 said , patient - satisfaction scores noticeably increased in a few days . the new gown \" was emblematic ... of an attitude that was conveyed to me at the hospital -- that they cared about me as a whole human being , not just the part they were operating on , \" said @entity20 , who received a liver transplant during the time the redesign was being tested . \" that was the subtext of that whole thing , was that they were caring about me as a person and what it meant for me to be comfortable . \" but replacing the traditional design is no easy task . what patients wear needs to be comfortable yet allow health professionals proper access during exams , meaning it must open and close easily . the gowns also need to be easily mass - manufactured , as well as efficiently laundered and reused . new designs , though , can be expensive . after @entity21 of @entity22 , @entity23 , switched to pajamas and gowns that provide extra coverage , costs went up $ 70,000 per year , said @entity24 , the facility \\'s chief supply chain officer , because the new garments cost more to buy and maintain . beyond cost , more ingrained cultural expectations might also play a role in what hospitals think patients should wear , said @entity25 , an assistant professor of medicine at @entity26 , who co-authored a 2014 study in the journal @entity27 , examining whether gowns were important and whether patients might be fine wearing their own or hospital - provided pants , instead of or along with gowns . often , doctors reported that pants or undergarments beneath gowns would have been okay , but patients said they were never given those options . traditional gowns make it easier to examine patients quickly , and several doctors @entity25 spoke to seemed shocked at the idea that patients might wear garments other than the open - backed gown during their stay . but the most common challenge is n\\'t necessarily doctor expectations or costs . it \\'s navigating hospital bureaucracies , said @entity28 , president of the @entity29 -

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 blooming in @entity2 , @entity3 , along the @entity4 is @entity5 , a wholesale flower market that attracts more than 2,000 sellers each day . photographer @entity6 visited the market for his project \" @entity7 , \" which is a series of portraits that casts light upon the people behind the petals . when @entity6 was in @entity2 working on another assignment , he went to the market as a tourist . after that first encounter with @entity5 , his captivation with the market did not diminish and he became intent on returning . \" ( the flower sellers ) woke my curiosity . but at that time , i did n\\'t really have the time to do the project , \" @entity6 said . \" and this idea just kind of stuck in my head for almost two years . \" @entity6 was able to spend about 10 days at the market , and did not allow any challenges to hinder the completion of \" @entity7 . \" he said that in addition to language barriers and the heat of @entity2 making communication complicated and shooting at certain times difficult , another adversity he faced was taking portraits of the female flower sellers . \" i had a really clear idea before i went ( to the market ) about what i wanted to do , \" @entity6 said . \" i wanted to shoot the sellers -- the male and the female sellers . \" but none of the female flower sellers wished to be a part of @entity6 \\'s project , so he focused only on those who were interested in and comfortable with having their portrait taken . for the portraits , @entity6 sought a neutral background . he first tried shooting under a bridge near the market , but quickly realized the lighting did not match the mood he wanted to create . he then decided to create the portraits by the @entity4 . this allowed him to combine the hazy smog in the air , sunlight from above and studio lights of his own , which culminated to produce a surreal effect and overexposed look that made his subjects stand out . \" all the pictures are shot within noon and 3 p.m. when you have the sun straight from above , which gives ( the portraits ) this very hard light , \" @entity6 said . \" and then i just used some studio light as a fill to make it a little bit more soft . \" although the composition of the majority of @entity6 \\'s portraits encompasses the flower sellers in front of a neutral background , other portraits forgo this characteristic and consequently bring a sense of movement and fluidity to \" @entity7 . \" viewers may see people or a dog appearing in a frame , or even birds flying in the sky and a boat floating in the water . one of the reasons @entity6 did not create the flower sellers \\' portraits directly inside the market is because of the hectic atmosphere . @entity6 compares @entity5 to the environments of financial trading and fish markets . \" it \\'s impossible to shoot at the market , especially if you want a clean and quiet background , because there \\'s so much going on , \" @entity6 said . social media follow @ @entity8 on @entity9 to join the conversation about photography . similar to the commitment needed to effectively and successfully operate within the financial and food industries , @entity6 emphasized that the competitive atmosphere of the market and work ethic of the flower sellers was a major factor in whether a seller would agree to have their portrait made . \" all the other sellers -- they are so busy , so just convincing them to go near the river to get their portrait done and spend maybe 15 minutes of their time was a challenge , \" @entity6 said . \" because every minute they \\'re not standing in the flower ( market ) , they lose money . \" @entity6 said that another important reason some flower sellers decided not to be photographed was because flowers are highly valued in @entity3 and serve as a prominent feature during many events and moments in people \\'s lives , including everything from religious rituals and festivals to weddings and parties . \" some of the flowers , ( the sellers ) did n\\'t allow us to take pictures of because they \\'re flowers used for offering in the temple , \" @entity6 said . \" it was more a problem about the flowers than actually the guy behind , because they did n\\'t want us to take the pictures because ( the flowers would ) lose their purity . \" challenging perceptions and breaking down barriers are underlying elements within \" @entity7 . \" @entity6 said viewers must not make assumptions about the socioeconomic status of the sellers , nor should they view the sellers through a fixed , rigid lens regarding the behaviors and roles associated with gender . noticeable throughout the portraits is that none of the sellers is smiling , which is usually a behavior people tend to exhibit when in the presence of a camera . the lack of a smile enhances the organic nature of \" @entity7 , \" making the portraits a powerful representation of unforced and unfabricated human emotion . \" if you want to take pictures in @entity3 , people tend to just stand up and look proud and strong , \" @entity6 said . \" it \\'s very different from the western world because if you take pictures here , people tend to smile . \" like people , flowers come in all shapes , sizes and colors . when viewing @entity6 \\'s photos , this fact leaves viewers to consider if it is not the flowers that are decorations , but rather the sellers who bring vibrancy to the flowers . in the portrait of @entity10 , for example , he is engulfed in endless layers of orange . \" they use these flowers in temples and all over @entity3 , so that \\'s one of the more common flowers at the market , \" @entity6 said . \" i really like that picture because they carry the flowers like it is a dress . you should see when they walk through the flower market , it \\'s almost like ( the flowers are ) all alive . \" similarly , the abundant leaves come to life in @entity11 \\'s portrait . \" these are a special kind of leaves , and many of ( the sellers ) carry them on their head and ( on their ) arms , \" @entity6 said . \" and when they walk around , it \\'s almost like a human bush or something like that . \" @entity6 plans to return to @entity5 and looks forward not only to the opportunity to photograph different kinds of flowers -- as the range varies based on the seasons -- but also to the chance to present the flower sellers featured in \" @entity7 \" with their portraits . \" i enjoyed this project , \" @entity6 said . \" there \\'s a lot of photographers going to @entity3 and then showing a poor , bad situation . ... i have a totally different approach . i want to show some more proudness and find the beauty of people . \" @entity6 is a photographer based in @entity12 . you can follow

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 is in the headlines again . according to a @entity2 report thursday , @entity3 nuclear experts have told the @entity4 that @entity5 may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads . and while that number may seem stunning , it is actually only part of a troubling story . the key takeaway from the latest assessment of @entity1 \\'s nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country \\'s weapons capabilities . true , the reported @entity3 estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear \" arsenal . \" however , this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by @entity4 and other experts . the big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that @entity1 could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium . if that assessment is correct , and @entity5 can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the @entity4 and members of the @entity6 talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial . after all , the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually . this news could be much more serious . why ? for a start , it would mean that @entity1 \\'s activities would undoubtedly meet the definition , if it had not already , of a runaway nuclear weapons program , with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in @entity1 \\'s mines . in addition , while the plutonium program at @entity7 has a clear and detectable profile , the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium - based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile , meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in @entity1 , undetectable from the sky , but in any large warehouse . @entity8 and @entity9 have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying @entity1 threats , at least when there is n\\'t a full - fledged crisis going on . for example , the @entity4 downplayed @entity1 \\'s missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in december 2012 . and up until 2006 , no one thought the @entity10 regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test . these new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat @entity1 poses once again . but thursday \\'s report is n\\'t the only troubling information we have had recently . just as concerning is the @entity11 commander \\'s assessment on @entity1 \\'s missile capabilities . on april 7 , adm. @entity12 said during a press briefing that the @entity13 believed @entity5 \\'s @entity14 intercontinental ballistic missile ( @entity15 ) is operational , with a warhead capacity . this statement is troubling for two reasons . first , @entity12 \\'s statement , when combined with the latest @entity3 assessment , implies that @entity1 now not only has nuclear weapons , but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the @entity4 mainland . second , and just as importantly , @entity5 \\'s advances in mobile icbm capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the @entity16 . put simply , these capabilities could give @entity1 confidence that it is immune from any @entity4 counterstrikes . and if that ends up being the case , the @entity4 could find itself with a renewed headache in @entity17 -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling .',\n",

term business , and the @entity4 conflict is n\\'t ending anytime soon . so i decided to meet the guy . we spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $ 6,500 . some of the money would be deposited into an insurance company , with the usual transaction fees . when i reached @entity8 the money would be released to the smuggler -- or , if i changed my mind , i \\'d be able to get some of it back . \" be ready all day , every day for the next few days , because you might receive the call to go , \" the smuggler told me . one evening a few days later , i got the call and my journey began . they gathered 100 men and women in five buses and drove us to the smuggling point . it was far from @entity9 . we walked for 30 minutes , through rough terrain and orange farms near the beach , in darkness to avoid detection by police . the idea was to take us in three small boats to the main ship . i still remember an old lady , barely able to walk , with her two sons , marching along as fast as they could to try to reach the boats . they were told that if they did n\\'t walk faster , the boat would leave without them . i asked myself so many time what could possibly drive a normal person to put himself and his family in this kind of danger . i decided that anyone with a past but no future was capable of doing crazy things . finally we reached the boat . it was just as the smuggler described . for three days we waited in the boat for two other parties of 100 people to join us before departing . we were in the middle of the @entity2 , far enough away from the surrounding countries to be in international waters . on the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy , ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate , nameless numbers who never made it to the other side . but there was no going back -- it \\'s a one - way ticket . we sailed for eight hours before the boat \\'s engine broke down . there were around 300 of us on board , and as the waves began to push us towards @entity10 the crew sent a distress signal , hoping to alert maybe a @entity11 or @entity12 boat , anyone who could help us . eventually our boat hit a cliff and got stuck . luckily , before long , a @entity10 coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to @entity5 . @entity5 authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours . some of the people i had been traveling with said they were n\\'t going to try to make the trip again . when they asked me what i planned to do , i told them i would do it again tomorrow if i could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works , where no one is bigger than nature , where you can feel so small , no matter how big your dreams are . i \\'d already lost everything . my family did n\\'t know what i was doing , but i dreamed of being a human being who is treated like one . i was n\\'t going to stop . so i called the smuggler the same night i was released , and said i wanted to get on the next ship out . two days later i received the call , and again i headed to a smuggling point . this time , they had a bigger boat -- a cargo ship , in fact , maybe 85 meters long or more . it took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total , refugees from cities all over @entity4 . and for the first time , i began to feel like i was in jail , trapped in conditions no human should ever suffer . we lived in the hold . there were no mattresses or sheets , but we found some wooden planks to put our stuff on to keep it from getting wet . hundreds of migrants killed when boat capsizes for five days we had no food and little water . but at least it meant not having to make frequent trips to the \" toilet , \" if you could call it that , which was an old car tire covered with a piece of cloth . huge waves crashed against the ship from all angles and water leaked in from the ceiling as we slept on the cold metal floor of the ship , the smell of urine emanating from the corner . seven days in , despite the poor conditions , everything was going well and we were nearing the island - dotted seas near @entity13 . on the eleventh day , 200 miles off the coast of southern @entity8 our guides began to alert @entity8 authorities to our presence . we were adrift at sea , they told the authorities , with no captain or crew . and that was actually true -- we did n\\'t have a registered pilot , just one guy who had worked on this ship before . an @entity14 ship -- working in conjunction with @entity15 , the joint @entity16 border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from @entity17 . the rescue ship approached us but was unable to get close at first because the waves were so high . we knew we would have to wait some time before leaving our boat forever . the other refugees were waving their hands like children and then telling each other : \" stop waving , they \\'ve already seen us . \" i was one of the last 10 people to be rescued from the boat . i can still see it like it was yesterday ; it was the rebirth of a new life . why migrants head to @entity2 they took us to @entity18 , on @entity19 , where we finally reached land a day later . when we arrived , the first thing the @entity8 authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases . there was a man who was poisoned by the drinking water on the boat , a few pregnant women and old people who needed medical attention . they took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted . they were saying : \" we did n\\'t risk everything to be refugees . we are not going to give our fingerprints , even if they torture us . \" later that night a @entity20 -

he would certainly work hard for universal health care , which has been a passion of his . i \\'ve heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system -- the single - payer system -- that has worked well throughout @entity20 for decades , reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well . he would not be @entity21 \\'s best friend . indeed , he did n\\'t support president @entity22 in his efforts to bail out the bankers , and wrote an open letter to @entity23 , the @entity3 secretary of the treasury , protesting that bailout . famously , on december 10 , 2010 , he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the @entity4 opposing the reinstatement of bush - era tax cuts , a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand @entity1 \\'s views . he is a socialist , of course . how many @entity3 politicians have ever said this aloud ? and what does he really mean by that term ? @entity1 knows what he \\'s doing . by proclaiming himself a socialist , he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks , many with international bases , have controlled @entity3 public policy for a very long time , usually to the detriment of working people . and it \\'s working people who seem mostly to interest @entity1 . he has been one of only a few voices in the @entity4 in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right - wing factions funded by \" millionaires and billionaires \" ( one of @entity1 \\'s favorite mantras ) have held sway over @entity3 politics for as long as anyone can recall . and this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads , serve meals , deliver the mail , drive trucks and teach in schools . as president , @entity1 would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change . indeed , @entity1 co-sponsored with @entity24 the @entity25 of 2007 . he has , for years , been a tireless advocate for the environment , aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad . but does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the @entity11 nomination ? and if he won it , could he defeat a @entity26 candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal ? he \\'s not crazy . in fact , he \\'s probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes . but he ca n\\'t win , and he knows that . what he will do , however , is move @entity27 on matters of importance to progressives : the restraining of @entity21 and large corporations , the scandal of how @entity3 allows its political campaigns to be funded and the welfare of working class @entity3 , who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests . a steep climb looms before him . but i applaud @entity1 . i hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) the victory of a 72 - year - old former general , @entity1 , in the @entity2 elections represents a moment of maturity in @entity3 politics . @entity1 , who some 30 years ago was @entity2 \\'s harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self - described reformers have been . swath but the peaceful transition of power from president @entity4 to president @entity1 is the first of its kind in history . and the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary @entity2 have finally had enough of the venality of their elites . for too long , @entity2 \\'s poor have been victims of their country \\'s enormous wealth . the cancer of corruption has to be cut out . i visited @entity2 in january and found a country under siege . @entity5 , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand . soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire . it \\'s a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk . yet thanks to @entity2 \\'s oil , there is also tremendous wealth in @entity5 . and when you do n\\'t really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know . graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24 - hour party palace at the @entity6 . the richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime . for a while , that system brought some stability to the government of @entity4 . but stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel . lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development . one was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run . the problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n\\'t come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government \\'s few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal . the problem of corruption went hand - in - glove with the rise of terrorism . @entity2 is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it \\'s composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions . the south is dominated by @entity7 like @entity4 , the north by @entity8 like @entity1 . and the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by @entity9 , which translates as \" @entity10 education is forbidden . \" westerners might assume that @entity9 \\'s major target is the @entity11 south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist @entity8 as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on @entity12 population centers . failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to @entity9 \\'s strategic ingenuity . previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . in 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in @entity5 . few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . and soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . the government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in @entity2 as a consultant on a business visa ) . what is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . and the @entity4 government might have benefited from the @entity9 terrorist emergency continuing in @entity8 centers , for the @entity8 were far more likely to vote for @entity1 . for @entity1 to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in @entity11 areas -- and there , again , a @entity10 prejudice is challenged . the victory of a @entity8 candidate in @entity2 does not represent the victory of @entity13 , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the @entity8 world to govern itself . on the contrary , @entity1 is associated with an earlier period in @entity2 history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . he ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . but he also ran a @entity14 when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . @entity1 was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of @entity9 and corruption . get the army functioning properly again , @entity2 hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . @entity1 has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . but they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule . you can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the @entity1 now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered . on its website , the @entity1 prominently states , \" it \\'s our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed . \" and later , it says that \" in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second . \" but the @entity1 is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former @entity2 athletes . the lawsuit claimed the students did n\\'t get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in @entity1 history . in its response , the @entity1 says it has no legal responsibility \" to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student - athletes at its member institutions . \" even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the @entity1 has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , @entity1 attorneys wrote in this court filing that \" the @entity1 did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student - athletes , \" and \" the @entity1 does not have \\' direct , day - to - day , operational control \\' \" over member institutions like @entity2 . \" it \\'s nonsense . it \\'s double talk , \" said @entity3 , a former athletic - academic director who is now president of @entity4 for academic integrity in collegiate sport . \" if you look at their basic core principles , it \\'s all about academics , the experience , the integration of academics , and the education of the student is paramount , \" @entity3 said . \" they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths . \" the @entity1 referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : the @entity1 believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the @entity1 \\'s role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the @entity1 has taken to assist student - athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field . \" this case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the @entity1 to ensure that every student - athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them , \" said @entity5 , @entity1 chief legal officer . in its response to the lawsuit , it also likened its role to that of the @entity6 or @entity7 , and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately . the scandal at @entity2 involved thousands of athletes who , over 18 years , were funneled into classes that never met , where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports . @entity8 , the @entity2 whistleblower turned @entity1 critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they \\'re academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required . the system of eligibility that the @entity1 brags about , she says , is a sham . \" why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n\\'t legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway ? it makes no sense , \" said @entity8 , who recently wrote a book about the @entity2 scandal called \" cheated . \" \" if they ca n\\'t legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that , then why certify students semester after semester to play ? it \\'s lost its meaning for me . \" the @entity1 \\'s claim that it \\'s hands - off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , @entity9 , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes . for example , before it lost a case filed by former @entity10 player @entity11 , suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses , the @entity1 stood on the pillar of amateurism , insisting that college athletes are paid with an education . that \\'s the defense the @entity1 is now using in another class action filed by big - time sports attorney @entity12 , seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value . in response , the @entity1 said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : consistent with \" its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with @entity1 bylaws . \" attorney @entity13 , who represented both @entity11 and now the @entity2 athletes , said this : \" this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the @entity1 \\'s shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes . @entity1 president @entity9 has repeatedly proposed that \\' what we live for is the education of our athletes , \\' but the @entity1 \\'s record tells a far different story . \" but @entity14 , professor of sport management at @entity15 , said it \\'s not realistic to think that the @entity1 would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country . \" i understand , i think , where the @entity1 is coming from . we would not let the @entity1 come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at @entity15 , \" he said . \" it sounds like someone is trying to say the @entity1 should have been supervising that department at the @entity2 , and there \\'s no logic to that , \" he said . \" the people who are saying the @entity1 should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the @entity1 . \" @entity2 , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the \" educational malpractice \" theory does n\\'t apply . @entity2 claims it is protected by state law . this is reminiscent of another @entity1 reversal . the @entity1 , which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from \" dangerous and exploitive athletic practices , \" now says it does not enforce health and safety rules . in fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the @entity1 wrote : \" the @entity1 denies that it has a legal duty to protect student - athletes . \" a @entity0 investigation found that the @entity1 has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken . it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the @entity16 . @entity17 , president of the @entity18 , and a leading thorn in the @entity1 \\'s side for decades , said this latest backpedaling from the @entity1 leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all . \" there \\'s nothing left the @entity1 can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society . one has to wonder what does the @entity1 do if it does n\\'t protect players ?

in january jihadists killed 14 @entity1 soldiers near @entity59 . @entity20 detects a changing pattern since the @entity6 conflict began . it has injected more money into the smuggling business , which has therefore become more organized . the more reliable groups can charge more ; she says some migrants buy a \" package \" from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel . @entity6 migrants are relatively better off than @entity64 , and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel . @entity35 are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks , or consigned to an inflatable dinghy . fearing arrest , the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves , instead giving a compass or gps device to the migrants , who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port . as @entity1 becomes more dangerous for migrants , other countries on both sides of the @entity9 are looking on anxiously . some @entity64 opt to travel through @entity23 -- even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to @entity65 very difficult . \" a migrant might need 50 or 60 attempts before making it to the @entity65 coast , \" says @entity20 . @entity22 has massively increased security along its eastern border with @entity1 ;

some @entity5 who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions ( the road to hell , after all ) . consider : the tragedy of modern @entity9 is in its endless sequence of tragedies . before my time , the brutal @entity12 invasion of @entity13 horrified many @entity5 . when i was in high school , @entity14 occupied all our attention . there was of course @entity15 \\'s brutal war on the @entity16 people — @entity1 shares his name with a recent @entity16 patriot -- and @entity17 \\'s ongoing occupation of the @entity18 territories . and the blows against @entity5 do n\\'t end there . there was @entity19 \\'s war on @entity20 , another war in @entity21 , the invasion of @entity22 , oppression in @entity23 , civil strife in @entity24 , the colonization of @entity25 , massacres of @entity5 in the @entity26 , wars on a besieged @entity27 and @entity28 still under @entity17 rule . imagine how this looks to a restless young muslim . countless places where co-religionists have been killed , and nobody seems to do anything about it . nobody even wants to . extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening , and then moved quickly to a single , tempting , terrible response : take up arms — and kill . in her new book , \" heretic : why @entity9 needs a @entity29 \" , @entity30 argues that extremism is n\\'t caused by political circumstances , but by @entity9 itself . her conclusion is wrong . to fight extremism , we do n\\'t need to reform @entity9 . we need to show young @entity5 that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to . rather than help @entity5 , it \\'s harming them . when i was a teenager , our @entity31 mosque hosted a delegation from @entity14 that shared graphic , heartbreaking stories of rape , exile , and massacre inflicted on @entity5 , all because of their faith . the mosque raised money , collected food , blankets , medicine . promises were made to provide more , and regularly . but we all knew that was n\\'t enough . as we left the mosque , my peers and i were disgruntled and confused . shocked . angry . our teachers could \\'ve told us : go and fight . defend your @entity5 brothers and sisters who are under siege . or they could \\'ve told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably . neither answer would have satisfied . fortunately for us , they offered us a third way . they showed us , patiently , how to work with others , how to compromise , how to get things done . a more engaged @entity4 @entity5 community , they explained , could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world . they were right . we saw the dead - end road of radicalism from afar , but we also saw , up close , how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless , ineffectual and ignored . thanks to social media , a medium that the world \\'s burgeoning young @entity5 population is increasingly comfortable with , more muslims can and will see this , too . radicalism will be done in by fellow @entity5 who want to save their religion from this monster within it . it \\'s happening already . our national conversation about @entity9 is focused on the wrong issues . does @entity9 need a reformation ? what in @entity9 causes violence ? we would do a lot better if we accepted that @entity5 the world over have real grievances — dictatorships , corruption , foreign intervention , religious illiteracy , lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these . we need to show the young @entity32 that , if they want to help , then violence is n\\'t going to help . to fight extremism , we need to pose this question to young @entity5 : \" do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith ? \" because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse . their narrative has failed . their solution is bankrupt . the @entity33 wears no clothes . it \\'s the reason why increasing numbers of @entity5 reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing .',\n",

most walk -- to a missionary hospital in a neighboring village , 12 kilometers ( 7.4 miles ) away from here . now she is back , wondering what the next step for her is . throughout this region , there have been small landslides and people have been industrious in clearing rubble from the roads . there is little sign of aid having made it out here . out of necessity people are back working their fields . near the road a family makes lunch in the open as their house was destroyed . elsewhere in @entity0 , other unfortunate families count the cost of the disaster . @entity6 , 31 , lost his only daughter , @entity7 in the quake , who was killed as their house collapsed . she was 2 years old . he was working when the quake hit , tilling the fields like so many in @entity8 , and ran back to his house after quickly realizing the force of the tremor . \" i started digging with my hands , \" he says , still very much in shock , but remembering his frantic efforts among the remains of his damaged home . \" and i saw her , blood was trickling from her mouth and she was covered in cuts . \" all he has left now is a picture in his phone ;

( there have been ) significant gains against @entity4 -- particularly in @entity8 -- and it \\'s no coincidence we \\'ve seen isis make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in @entity9 . it \\'s asymmetric warfare , they know they can not hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw ... then take initiative elsewhere . they have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere . it continues their image of initiative , of shocking , of reshaping the world -- which is what they are trying to do . @entity1 : what does the map tell us about the coalition \\'s strategy ? @entity10 : it \\'s very telling . there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the @entity3 forces . it \\'s a push against the front line of @entity4 rather than being brave and creative and going in behind @entity4 \\'s lines and breaking it up . what this is n\\'t is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push . the capability you need ( for this kind of warfare ) is much more high - tech than the capabilities the @entity3 have . those capabilities are available in the region -- @entity11 , @entity12 and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it \\'s very interesting that the @entity13 nations have not developed an effective coalition to target @entity4 which is an existential threat . @entity1 : what about @entity14 ? @entity4 seems to be winning there . @entity10 : @entity14 has been a potential battlefield for the past decade . but in this context ( @entity4 ) will ... be pushing in @entity14 because that \\'s an area they have lots of support . it also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains . the concept of success is hugely important to them -- it \\'s what sustains the recruitment effort of @entity4 . nobody wants to join a bunch of losers , so it \\'s very important for them to be seen to be succeeding . above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media . they are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in @entity15 and killing refugees in camps like @entity16 . but where it counts they are not standing and fighting .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 , who appears to have been the only @entity2 citizen held hostage by @entity3 , was accidentally killed in a @entity2 drone strike in january . but it did n\\'t have to be that way . a senior @entity2 official familiar with the handling of the issue told @entity0 that the @entity2 government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73 - year - old development expert \\'s release , either directly to @entity3 or through proxies in @entity4 . another senior @entity2 official told @entity0 that @entity1 \\'s capture by @entity3 made it hard for the @entity2 to negotiate , even though proxies such as the @entity4 government have links to intermediaries who might have helped . a senior @entity4 official told @entity0 that after @entity1 was kidnapped , the @entity4 government put out feelers to members of the militant @entity5 and to the @entity4 @entity6 , which are both allied to @entity3 , to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about @entity1 . according to the official , nothing came of those feelers . the senior @entity4 official says that during the past year @entity4 soldiers , who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of @entity7 near the @entity8 - @entity4 border where @entity1 was believed to be being held , went door - to - door looking for the @entity2 . nothing came of this search either . on thursday , the @entity2 government announced that @entity1 had been killed in a \" counterterrorism operation \" in january , which is how the government often describes @entity9 drone strikes . according to @entity10 , which tracks drone strikes in @entity4 , @entity9 drone attacks happened in @entity11 , @entity7 , on january 19 in which at least four militants were killed ; also on january 15 in @entity12 , @entity13 , in which at least five militants were killed ; and on january 4 in @entity14 , @entity13 , in which at least eight militants were killed . it is in one of these strikes that @entity1 was almost certainly killed . lt. col. @entity15 , a planner on the @entity16 staff , is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to @entity2 rep. @entity17 \\'s office , which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of @entity2 hostages held by @entity3 and the @entity6 . a plan was developed in the @entity18 to secure the release of @entity1 , according to a staff member on @entity17 \\'s committee . that plan was to release @entity19 , a prominent and influential member of the @entity6 who is in prison in the @entity2 on drug trafficking charges , in exchange for @entity16 sgt. @entity20 , who was held by the @entity6 until last year ; @entity6 hostages @entity21 , a @entity2 citizen , and her husband , @entity22 @entity23 ; and dr. @entity24 , who spied for the @entity9 in @entity4 and was being held in a @entity4 prison , as well as @entity1 . it \\'s not clear how far this plan of action went . @entity15 is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure . @entity17 , a @entity25 @entity26 , released a statement thursday , saying , \" the only government organization seriously developing options to recover @entity1 and others in the @entity8 / @entity4 region was within the @entity18 -- led by war hero @entity15 . \" as an @entity16 captain , @entity15 led a small detachment of @entity27 into @entity8 in november 2001 in the wake of the september 11 attacks on the @entity2 . the operation was instrumental in helping to topple the @entity6 and to install @entity28 as the new leader of @entity8 . who exactly carried out @entity1 \\'s kidnapping from his house 3½ years ago in the @entity4 megacity of @entity29 has until now not been clear . a senior @entity4 counterterrorism official told @entity0 that members of the @entity30 , or @entity30 , kidnapped @entity1 at his @entity29 home on august 13 , 2011 . @entity30 is an @entity31 terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of @entity4 along its border with @entity8 . according to the @entity4 official , the leader of the @entity32 kidnapping cell was a relative of @entity33 , the former @entity30 leader killed in a @entity9 drone strike in the @entity4 tribal regions in 2009 . the initial lead that traced the @entity1 kidnapping to the @entity30 came from another high - profile kidnapping in @entity4 two weeks after @entity1 \\'s abduction . @entity34 , the son of a leading @entity4 liberal politician @entity35 -- who was killed by @entity4 militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in @entity29 on august 26 , 2011 . at the scene of @entity35 \\'s kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and sim card that eventually led @entity4 officials to focus on the @entity30 group in @entity29 , according to the senior @entity4 counterterrorism official . the police subsequently arrested three @entity31 and four @entity4 who were part of the @entity30 cell that had carried out the @entity1 kidnapping . members of the @entity30 cell told @entity4 interrogators that after they had kidnapped @entity1 they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in @entity29 . @entity30 members then took @entity1 to the @entity36 in @entity4 , a semi-autonomous region along the border with @entity8 where @entity3 and other militant groups are headquartered . there @entity1 was given or , more likely , sold to @entity3 , according to the senior @entity4 official . who was @entity1 ? @entity1 had spent his life helping others , working in the fields of aid and development . he held a doctorate in international law and economics from @entity37 and spoke more than half a dozen languages . after his capture , the leader of @entity3 , @entity38 , demanded the end of @entity9 drone strikes in @entity4 and the release of terrorists held in @entity2 custody in exchange for @entity1 \\'s freedom . on september 12 , 2012 , @entity1 appeared in a video produced by @entity3 \\'s production arm in which he said that the @entity39 administration had shown \" no interest in my case . \" he then appealed to @entity40 prime minister @entity41 from \" one jew to another \" to intervene . the @entity39 administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy , which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by @entity42 , @entity3 or the @entity6 . the key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the @entity2 government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them . the @entity9 , for instance , is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations , while the @entity43 has responsibility for retrieving @entity2 hostages . often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with @entity1 . the @entity9 could have exercised more due diligence knowing that @entity1 was almost certainly being held in @entity7 . there are some solutions for these problems . first , families should be granted security clearances by the @entity2 government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones . right now , the @entity2 government wo n\\'t communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives do n\\'t have the requisite security clearances . should families abuse their clearances , they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones , which is a strong incentive not to abuse them . second , president @entity39 should appoint a senior - level person , perhaps working in the @entity44 on the @entity45 , to oversee the work of the @entity9 , @entity43 , @entity46 and the @entity47 , which implements hostage rescues . all these organizations have key roles to play in getting @entity2 hostages home . that person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \" de-conflict \" any potential issues , such as the ones that surfaced in the @entity1 case . third , while the @entity2 government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups , there is nothing in @entity2 policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of @entity2 citizens , and this should be encouraged , even if there is some quid pro quo involved . this is what happened in the case of the @entity2 journalist @entity48 , who was captured by @entity3 \\'s affiliate in @entity49 in 2012 , but was released last year after the @entity50 government intervened in his case . the @entity50 have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in @entity49 , including the @entity3 affiliate holding @entity48 , and while @entity50 officials have denied paying ransom to free @entity48 , it \\'s unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of @entity3 holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys . @entity48 \\' successful release could provide a ray of hope for @entity2 citizen @entity21 and her husband , @entity22 @entity23 , who were captured by the @entity6 in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through @entity8 . a senior @entity2 official told @entity0 they are being held by the @entity5 . the @entity4 government has contacts with the @entity5 , and the @entity2 government should ratchet up the pressure on the @entity4 government to secure the couple \\'s release . in captivity , @entity51 , who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage , had a child . the name of the child is unknown .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) on the stage of a tv studio in @entity1 , @entity2 @entity3 is telling an engrossed audience a tragic , but familiar , story . on april 17 , 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as @entity3 knew it was shattered when her hometown , the @entity4 capital of @entity1 , fell to the genocidal @entity5 regime of the @entity6 . @entity3 , then 13 , was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who , along with virtually the entire population of @entity1 -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work . @entity3 never saw them again , nor learned what happened to them . but about 20,000 people died from execution , starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint , according to war crimes prosecutors ; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination , where many met similar fates . the urban evacuation marked the first phase in the @entity5 \\'s revolutionary program of social engineering , intended to establish a new order -- free of money , family ties , religion , education , property and foreign influence . aimed at creating an agrarian utopia , it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era , resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million @entity4 -- about a quarter of the country \\'s population -- over the next four years . @entity3 remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings , three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years , before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979 . his killing prompted @entity3 to leave her sole remaining family member , youngest sister @entity7 , in the care of a local couple . she set out on her own , making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the @entity8 . for more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister . \" i think she was the only family member to survive , \" she says , with tears in her eyes . as she finishes her story , the producers usher a woman on the stage . it \\'s @entity7 . @entity3 embraces her sister and both women sob . \" i missed you so much , \" @entity3 says . \" i \\'ve always searched for you , \" @entity7 tells her . since production began five years ago , the television show , \" it \\'s not a dream , \" has reunited members of 54 @entity4 families shattered by the genocide . more than 1,500 have sought its help . the series is just one example of the ways in which @entity4 \\'s traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught , painful business of reckoning with their history . \" the scars of the @entity5 are very deep and physical and present in modern @entity4 , \" said @entity9 , a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime , and who moved to the @entity8 as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult . she described the country as a \" land of orphans . \" for decades after the @entity5 were driven from @entity1 by @entity10 - backed @entity11 forces in january 1979 , the regime \\'s crimes were seldom spoken about , let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims . in large part , this was because people remained scared , say experts . far from being snuffed out by the @entity11 invasion , the @entity5 existed for another two decades . after fleeing the capital in 1979 , @entity5 leader @entity12 and his supporters established a stronghold in the west . they continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government - in - exile that , until 1990 , was recognized by the @entity13 as the country \\'s only legitimate representative . \" in many villages , people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades , \" said @entity14 , executive director of the @entity15 . @entity16 , a @entity4 expert at the @entity17 at @entity18 , said that \" for many years , there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the @entity5 , as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room . \" the silence was also due to the fact that @entity4 , in @entity9 \\'s words , \" lacked the vocabulary \" of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society . the @entity5 \\'s attempts to reboot society at \" @entity19 \" had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country \\'s educated classes -- doctors , lawyers , accountants , engineers , merchants and clergy . \" nearly two generations of young @entity4 men grew up learning little more than how to kill , \" said @entity16 . \" when it was finally time to rebuild , there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again . \" even today , said @entity20 , young @entity4 are not taught about the genocide in high school . in an impoverished country -- one of @entity21 \\'s poorest , albeit with 7 % predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back , she said . some were even skeptical that the @entity5 \\'s crimes -- the systematic butchery of the \" killing fields \" -- had really occurred , she added . the space for discussing , redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the @entity22 , said @entity9 . founded in 2006 , the @entity22 in the @entity23 ( @entity22 ) is a \" hybrid \" tribunal using both @entity4 and international judges and staff to investigate the @entity5 \\'s crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice . intended as a southeast @entity21 equivalent of the @entity24 , the tribunal , which has cost $ 232 million so far , initially enjoyed broad support . \" we had great hope for this process , \" said @entity9 . \" the presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the @entity5 crimes . \" but the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial , given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals , two of whom have died while facing trial . another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial . ( the @entity5 \\'s top leader , @entity12 , died in 1998 , having never faced charges . ) this , coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the @entity4 government , has soured attitudes towards the court . @entity25 , who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings , today regards it as a \" sham . \" for many victims , it is \" too little , too late . \" opinion : an ongoing struggle for justice after the @entity5 in the first case heard , @entity26 , also known as comrade duch -- commandant of the notorious @entity27 where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture . the court \\'s only other verdicts , delivered in august last year , sentenced @entity28 , the regime \\'s \" brother number two , \" and @entity29 , \" brother @entity30 , \" to life . both men have appealed their convictions . in a separate case , the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide . evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016 , @entity22 spokesman @entity31 said . two further , and highly controversial cases , known as 003 and 004 , are also currently under investigation . three people were charged last month in relation to those cases : former @entity5 navy commander @entity32 ; @entity33 , a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp ; and @entity34 , a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers . two other suspects are being investigated . @entity35 said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004 . prime minister @entity36 , @entity4 \\'s strongman leader for decades , has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004 , claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war . @entity36 himself is a former @entity5 battalion commander , who defected to the @entity11 side ; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like @entity25 as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal . others are more forgiving of the tribunal \\'s shortcomings . @entity16 , a former investigator for the tribunal , has described it as an \" imperfect vessel \" for delivering justice , but says @entity4 \\'s leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives : delivering justice for victims , and completing the reintegration of former @entity5 into society . he said the most important aspects of the tribunal \\'s work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in @entity4 society . \" in that respect , the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped , \" he added . undoubtedly , @entity4 today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece . @entity14 said the country has seen a wave of @entity5 memoirs , written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die . \" there \\'s a lot of people who want to tell the world they \\'ve been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad , \" she said . @entity29 , \" brother @entity30 , \" published one such effort ahead of his trial , while @entity37 , a @entity38 - educated former diplomat for the @entity5 regime , published his \" journey of a @entity39 \" in @entity40 in 2013 . he told an interviewer from @entity40 \\'s @entity41 last year that he believed that @entity5 dictator @entity12 \\'s prescriptions for @entity4 were sound . \" i remain convinced that the @entity42 analysis made by @entity12 of the socioeconomic situation of @entity4 , a poor and sparsely populated country , was correct , \" he said . for survivors , these self - serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take . but for a few of them , at least , @entity4 \\'s opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing , however bittersweet . on the stage of the \" it \\'s not a dream \" studio , as @entity3 hugs her long - lost sister , footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen . \" do you know the person in the video ? \" the show \\'s host asks . \" yes , \" @entity3 says . \" she is my mother . \" moments later , @entity43 , 77 , is brought up on stage . \" where have you two been ? \" @entity43 asks . \" i always worried about you two . \" \" i thought you died , \" @entity3 says . the three women cry and embrace . \" it is very miserable for all of us , \" the old woman says .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) this week , @entity1 surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it . she sure pushed the envelope . with her video , new logo and road trip , she opened a long communications campaign not only to \" rebrand \" herself but to completely reframe who she is , what she stands for and how she intends to run . we \\'ll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work . many in the press and on late - night television scratched their heads this week ; others were scathing . @entity2 -- a columnist for the @entity3 -- dismissed her launch video as a \" relentlessly , insultingly vapid \" effort of \" demographic box - checking . \" @entity4 lampooned it as a \" @entity5 commercial gone viral \" and also \" boring as s --- . \" since the media will likely be the stand - in primary opponent for @entity1 , their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter \\'s eyes . but from a marketing perspective , her launch may have been much more successful than critics think . the @entity6 announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate : to flip @entity7 \\'s message from self - absorbed \" i \" to empathetic \" we . \" while critics may sneer , it is hard to deny that the image it projects of @entity1 is more confident , fresher , simpler and forward - looking , with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies , @entity8 and @entity9 . @entity7 \\'s team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past , most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to @entity10 in 2008 . in marketing terms , rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name , term , symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers . reframing is a strategy that goes further : it seeks to change how a consumer ( or voter ) emotionally experiences an established brand . a rebrand may change how you think about a brand ; a reframe may change how you feel about it . in the @entity9 case , the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original @entity11 ; some thought the company was headed for oblivion . but when @entity12 returned as ceo , he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the @entity13 , which not only changed the way consumers thought about @entity9 , but how they experienced it . not only a rebrand -- but a reframe . take @entity1 \\'s road trip to @entity14 in the van nicknamed @entity15 . the press lampooned her , but i would bet that for many others , her unscripted and anonymous stop at @entity16 reinforced the \" everyday @entity17 \" campaign theme . @entity1 stood in line to order , an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast - food chain . also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most - ubiquitous element of her campaign : @entity7 \\'s new and controversial campaign logo . it is a brilliant , iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her , her message and her movement . in fact , her logo is all about movement . simple , confident , high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters , the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue @entity18 says it all : you are the important ones . i \\'m here to support you with everything i \\'ve got . let me help you move forward . taken together , all the pieces of @entity7 \\'s announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but , surprisingly , as one for the future . coincidentally , the way @entity19 announced his run for the @entity20 nomination most likely amplified the impact of @entity7 \\'s reframing . for all his posturing about being the new generation , @entity19 followed to a \" t \" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy : traditional stage and podium , dark suit , bright tie , wife and kids on camera , a live speech , all about himself , timed for the evening news . @entity19 \\'s logo , the signature of his image , drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered , even leaving @entity21 and @entity22 off the map of @entity17 . in stark contrast , @entity1 showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front . it was @entity1 who pulled the ultimate jiu - jitsu . there are those , of course , who will be alienated , if not disgusted , by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan . in a day when voters are yearning for authenticity , how do we know this is the real @entity1 or a candidate in a mask ? fair question . but for better or worse , mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that \\'s where most campaign dollars go . both sides know how to play , sometimes brilliantly . remember the @entity23 advertisements of 1984 , proclaiming \" @entity24 \" ? what we know is that over time , voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through . and if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate , that campaign will get into trouble fast . that \\'s why the key to @entity1 \\'s success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency . she must not only take the essence of a humble , empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication , she must also live it every day . otherwise there will be messaging \" schizophrenia , \" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she \\'ll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008 . in the meantime , one can imagine @entity7 getting a huge , satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts .',\n",

( in fact , @entity1 signed his own family up for \" @entity15 \" on the @entity17 exchange , taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers . ) @entity1 favors smaller government , while @entity16 are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less . and though @entity1 doubts that climate change is caused by humans , the @entity18 has noted that @entity16 view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue . sure , @entity1 is young and charismatic . but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding , @entity1 has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate . in february , he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website @entity19 . another @entity1 weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals . consider that his fellow contender for the @entity2 presidential nomination , sen. @entity20 of @entity21 , has been willing to present new ideas to the @entity2 base , such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana . or that another @entity2 candidate for president , sen. @entity22 of @entity23 is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand . by comparison , @entity1 seems cautious and ill - suited to the task of rousing @entity2 voters . with his early leap into the 2016 race , @entity1 is positioning himself as the next generation of @entity2 leadership . unfortunately , a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for @entity1 , and not for @entity5 voters .',\n",

@entity3 \\'s family in @entity19 was initially reluctant to take their case to @entity20 . @entity3 \\'s wife , @entity21 , and his two daughters worried that drawing attention to their loved one \\'s plight -- especially media attention -- would make @entity3 , a government contractor working with @entity22 in @entity4 , a more valuable hostage to his @entity2 captors . but the family switched course and went to their representatives in @entity20 in late 2013 after a video of @entity3 -- frail and apparently in declining health -- surfaced in which he said he felt \" totally abandoned and forgotten \" by his country . will the drone debate return ? more than a year later , that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the @entity23 and the @entity19 delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed @entity3 \\'s case with the @entity24 administration as well as @entity4 . the congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one , according to one of those lawmakers and a @entity25 aide . \" we do n\\'t get choked up too often at work , \" @entity26 said as she held back tears . \" but this is really hard . \" @entity27 is a foreign policy adviser to sen. @entity28 , @entity19 , who worked closely on the case . after the @entity6 announced that @entity3 had been accidentally killed in a january @entity5 drone strike , the aide \\'s first call was to @entity3 \\'s daughters . \" myself and my colleague worked really closely with them , talked to them all the time ... they \\'re just such good people , \" @entity26 said of the family . \" there \\'s a personal connection there . \" @entity28 and his staff had tracked the @entity3 case since news of his abduction surfaced in august 2011 , but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case , @entity28 \\'s staff joined forces with rep. @entity29 , the @entity23 \\' congressman , and began setting up meetings for the family . @entity28 \\'s staff set up meetings for the senator and @entity3 \\'s family with everyone from the @entity5 special representative to @entity7 and @entity4 to the @entity4 ambassador in @entity0 . @entity28 and sen. @entity30 , @entity19 , wrote to president @entity24 , calling on the @entity5 to beef up efforts to secure @entity3 \\'s release and dedicate more resources to the cause . and the staff and lawmakers helped the @entity31 weave through the network of agencies -- from the @entity32 to the @entity33 and the @entity6 -- working to bring @entity3 home . \" we focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated , \" @entity34 told @entity1 on thursday . \" the government is a bureaucracy , and you have to make sure that it \\'s working . \" but for the @entity23 and the families of other @entity5 hostages held by terror groups abroad , the government has n\\'t always worked well enough -- a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on @entity35 who worked to help them . @entity2 hostage @entity3 killed \" unfortunately , the assistance we received from other elements of the @entity36 was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years , \" @entity37 said in a statement thursday . \" we hope that my husband \\'s death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the @entity5 government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families . \" it \\'s a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of @entity5 hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient @entity5 government efforts to bring their loved ones home . @entity34 was \" saddened , disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring @entity3 home , \" he said in a statement thursday . and in an interview with @entity1 later in the day , he strayed away from blaming the @entity24 administration or people in various @entity5 agencies , instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system . the @entity3 family \\'s frustration with that system boiled over last summer when @entity18 , the @entity16 sergeant , was released by a @entity15 - affiliated group in exchange for five @entity38 prisoners . the @entity5 policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception . \" it \\'s one of those things where it \\'s both there \\'s some hope , but at the same time it caused them some great frustration , \" @entity34 recalled , saying the family asked : \" why not @entity3 ?

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 , who appears to have been the only @entity2 citizen held hostage by @entity3 , was accidentally killed in a @entity2 drone strike in january . but it did n\\'t have to be that way . a senior @entity2 official familiar with the handling of the issue told @entity0 that the @entity2 government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73 - year - old development expert \\'s release , either directly to @entity3 or through proxies in @entity4 . another senior @entity2 official told @entity0 that @entity1 \\'s capture by @entity3 made it hard for the @entity2 to negotiate , even though proxies such as the @entity4 government have links to intermediaries who might have helped . a senior @entity4 official told @entity0 that after @entity1 was kidnapped , the @entity4 government put out feelers to members of the militant @entity5 and to the @entity4 @entity6 , which are both allied to @entity3 , to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about @entity1 . according to the official , nothing came of those feelers . the senior @entity4 official says that during the past year @entity4 soldiers , who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of @entity7 near the @entity8 - @entity4 border where @entity1 was believed to be being held , went door - to - door looking for the @entity2 . nothing came of this search either . on thursday , the @entity2 government announced that @entity1 had been killed in a \" counterterrorism operation \" in january , which is how the government often describes @entity9 drone strikes . according to @entity10 , which tracks drone strikes in @entity4 , @entity9 drone attacks happened in @entity11 , @entity7 , on january 19 in which at least four militants were killed ; also on january 15 in @entity12 , @entity13 , in which at least five militants were killed ; and on january 4 in @entity14 , @entity13 , in which at least eight militants were killed . it is in one of these strikes that @entity1 was almost certainly killed . lt. col. @entity15 , a planner on the @entity16 staff , is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to @entity2 rep. @entity17 \\'s office , which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of @entity2 hostages held by @entity3 and the @entity6 . a plan was developed in the @entity18 to secure the release of @entity1 , according to a staff member on @entity17 \\'s committee . that plan was to release @entity19 , a prominent and influential member of the @entity6 who is in prison in the @entity2 on drug trafficking charges , in exchange for @entity16 sgt. @entity20 , who was held by the @entity6 until last year ; @entity6 hostages @entity21 , a @entity2 citizen , and her husband , @entity22 @entity23 ; and dr. @entity24 , who spied for the @entity9 in @entity4 and was being held in a @entity4 prison , as well as @entity1 . it \\'s not clear how far this plan of action went . @entity15 is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure . @entity17 , a @entity25 @entity26 , released a statement thursday , saying , \" the only government organization seriously developing options to recover @entity1 and others in the @entity8 / @entity4 region was within the @entity18 -- led by war hero @entity15 . \" as an @entity16 captain , @entity15 led a small detachment of @entity27 into @entity8 in november 2001 in the wake of the september 11 attacks on the @entity2 . the operation was instrumental in helping to topple the @entity6 and to install @entity28 as the new leader of @entity8 . who exactly carried out @entity1 \\'s kidnapping from his house 3½ years ago in the @entity4 megacity of @entity29 has until now not been clear . a senior @entity4 counterterrorism official told @entity0 that members of the @entity30 , or @entity30 , kidnapped @entity1 at his @entity29 home on august 13 , 2011 . @entity30 is an @entity31 terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of @entity4 along its border with @entity8 . according to the @entity4 official , the leader of the @entity32 kidnapping cell was a relative of @entity33 , the former @entity30 leader killed in a @entity9 drone strike in the @entity4 tribal regions in 2009 . the initial lead that traced the @entity1 kidnapping to the @entity30 came from another high - profile kidnapping in @entity4 two weeks after @entity1 \\'s abduction . @entity34 , the son of a leading @entity4 liberal politician @entity35 -- who was killed by @entity4 militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in @entity29 on august 26 , 2011 . at the scene of @entity35 \\'s kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and sim card that eventually led @entity4 officials to focus on the @entity30 group in @entity29 , according to the senior @entity4 counterterrorism official . the police subsequently arrested three @entity31 and four @entity4 who were part of the @entity30 cell that had carried out the @entity1 kidnapping . members of the @entity30 cell told @entity4 interrogators that after they had kidnapped @entity1 they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in @entity29 . @entity30 members then took @entity1 to the @entity36 in @entity4 , a semi-autonomous region along the border with @entity8 where @entity3 and other militant groups are headquartered . there @entity1 was given or , more likely , sold to @entity3 , according to the senior @entity4 official . who was @entity1 ? @entity1 had spent his life helping others , working in the fields of aid and development . he held a doctorate in international law and economics from @entity37 and spoke more than half a dozen languages . after his capture , the leader of @entity3 , @entity38 , demanded the end of @entity9 drone strikes in @entity4 and the release of terrorists held in @entity2 custody in exchange for @entity1 \\'s freedom . on september 12 , 2012 , @entity1 appeared in a video produced by @entity3 \\'s production arm in which he said that the @entity39 administration had shown \" no interest in my case . \" he then appealed to @entity40 prime minister @entity41 from \" one jew to another \" to intervene . the @entity39 administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy , which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by @entity42 , @entity3 or the @entity6 . the key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the @entity2 government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them . the @entity9 , for instance , is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations , while the @entity43 has responsibility for retrieving @entity2 hostages . often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with @entity1 . the @entity9 could have exercised more due diligence knowing that @entity1 was almost certainly being held in @entity7 . there are some solutions for these problems . first , families should be granted security clearances by the @entity2 government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones . right now , the @entity2 government wo n\\'t communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives do n\\'t have the requisite security clearances . should families abuse their clearances , they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones , which is a strong incentive not to abuse them . second , president @entity39 should appoint a senior - level person , perhaps working in the @entity44 on the @entity45 , to oversee the work of the @entity9 , @entity43 , @entity46 and the @entity47 , which implements hostage rescues . all these organizations have key roles to play in getting @entity2 hostages home . that person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and \" de-conflict \" any potential issues , such as the ones that surfaced in the @entity1 case . third , while the @entity2 government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups , there is nothing in @entity2 policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of @entity2 citizens , and this should be encouraged , even if there is some quid pro quo involved . this is what happened in the case of the @entity2 journalist @entity48 , who was captured by @entity3 \\'s affiliate in @entity49 in 2012 , but was released last year after the @entity50 government intervened in his case . the @entity50 have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in @entity49 , including the @entity3 affiliate holding @entity48 , and while @entity50 officials have denied paying ransom to free @entity48 , it \\'s unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of @entity3 holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys . @entity48 \\' successful release could provide a ray of hope for @entity2 citizen @entity21 and her husband , @entity22 @entity23 , who were captured by the @entity6 in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through @entity8 . a senior @entity2 official told @entity0 they are being held by the @entity5 . the @entity4 government has contacts with the @entity5 , and the @entity2 government should ratchet up the pressure on the @entity4 government to secure the couple \\'s release . in captivity , @entity51 , who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage , had a child . the name of the child is unknown .',\n",

in january jihadists killed 14 @entity1 soldiers near @entity59 . @entity20 detects a changing pattern since the @entity6 conflict began . it has injected more money into the smuggling business , which has therefore become more organized . the more reliable groups can charge more ; she says some migrants buy a \" package \" from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel . @entity6 migrants are relatively better off than @entity64 , and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel . @entity35 are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks , or consigned to an inflatable dinghy . fearing arrest , the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves , instead giving a compass or gps device to the migrants , who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port . as @entity1 becomes more dangerous for migrants , other countries on both sides of the @entity9 are looking on anxiously . some @entity64 opt to travel through @entity23 -- even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to @entity65 very difficult . \" a migrant might need 50 or 60 attempts before making it to the @entity65 coast , \" says @entity20 . @entity22 has massively increased security along its eastern border with @entity1 ; both @entity50 and @entity23 have begun building fences along their border -- against both terrorism and clandestine migration . but they may be little deterrent . the @entity3 writer @entity66 made the desperate voyage to and across the @entity9 himself . in his novel \" @entity67 , \" he describes the \" dangerous lure \" of escape . only too late do the migrants discover a grim reality at sea : \" \\' if @entity68 loved me he would not have brought me here , \\' groaned one of the passengers . assured he had uttered the most fitting farewell to life , he threw himself into the sea . the boat moved forward at the whim of the waves . \" meet the couple on a mission to save drowning migrants',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) for 12 years @entity1 felt worthless , frightened and alone , never knowing when her abusive husband would strike . but as a young mother in rural @entity2 with three children and barely a third grade education , she thought there was no way out . what began as psychological torment , name - calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe @entity1 feared for her life . one day , two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her . they probably would have succeeded , but after the first bullet was fired , @entity1 \\' two sons dragged her inside . still , in her deeply conservative community , it took neighbors two hours to call for help and @entity1 lost her arm . but the abuse did n\\'t stop there . when she returned home , @entity1 \\' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left . that \\'s when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began . @entity1 \\' case is dramatic , but in @entity2 , where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed , it \\'s hardly unusual . a 2012 @entity3 says gender - based violence is at epidemic levels in @entity2 and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide . according to the @entity4 , two women are killed there every day . there are many reasons why , beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country \\'s 36 - year - old civil war . during the conflict , atrocities were committed against women , who were used as a weapon of war . in 1996 , a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government . but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror , due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination . military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions . many remain in power , and they have not changed the way they view women . some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades - long conflict , most of them from indigenous @entity5 populations . nearly 20 years later , according to the @entity6 , levels of violent crime are higher in @entity2 than they were during the war . but despite the high homicide rate , the @entity4 estimates 98 % of cases never make it to court . women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep - rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny . in many cases , femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war , including rape , torture and mutilation . @entity7 drug cartels , organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness . authorities investigating drug - related killings are stretched thin , leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides . in many cases , crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation . many consider the @entity8 , or @entity9 , corrupt , under - resourced and ineffective . even if a case does get prosecuted , according to @entity10 , the country \\'s weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence . perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in @entity2 is the country \\'s deeply rooted patriarchal society . according to @entity11 , the representative of @entity4 women in @entity2 , \" 80 % of men believe that women need permission to leave the house , and 70 % of women surveyed agreed . \" this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence . rights groups say machismo not only condones violence , it places the blame on the victim . the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize . \" politicians do n\\'t think women are important , \" says former secretary general of the @entity12 for women @entity13 . \" political parties use women for elections . they give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor . \" lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty . many girls , especially in indigenous communities do n\\'t go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far . @entity13 says \" they are subject to rape , violence and forced participation in the drug trade . \" although the situation for girls and women in @entity2 is alarming , there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing . with the help of an organization known as @entity14 , or @entity15 , @entity1 was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved . he is now spending 27 years behind bars . @entity1 is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art. since 2008 , she and four other abuse survivors known as @entity16 , or \" @entity17 , \" have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories . the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly , but it also offers suggestions for change . and it \\'s having an impact . women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support . men are reacting , too . one of the main characters , @entity18 , says during one presentation , a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated . he said he wanted to be different . the taboo topic of gender - based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of @entity2 \\'s most vulnerable groups , indigenous @entity5 girls . in 2004 , with help from the @entity4 and other organizations , the @entity19 launched a community - based club known as @entity20 , or \" @entity21 \" . the goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential . senior program coordinator @entity22 says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves . \" they then share this information with their mothers and for the first time , they realize they are entitled to certain rights . \" @entity22 adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence . the @entity2 government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women . in 2008 , the @entity23 passed a law against femicide . two years later the attorney general \\'s office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women . in 2012 , the government established a joint task force for crimes against women , making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need . the government has also established a special 24 - hour court to attend to femicide cases . on the global front , the @entity24 was introduced in the @entity23 in 2007 ; it has been pending ever since . but last week the act was reintroduced in both the @entity25 and @entity26 . if approved , it would make reducing levels of gender - based violence a @entity27 foreign policy priority . pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from international nongovernmental organizations , which are on the front lines of the fight against gender - based discrimination in @entity2 . @entity28 , a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group @entity29 , says , \" we work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence . our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models , and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women . \" but the job is far from over . while there is tempered optimism and hope for change , the problem of gender - based violence in @entity2 is one that needs international attention and immediate action . @entity1 is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors , which has allowed her to move forward . but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures . for them , it \\'s a race against time and help can not come soon enough .',\n",

@entity13 no. \\' for there is no way a @entity8 can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous @entity14 into single - issue voters . i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . instead it looks like it \\'s going to be dragged down to a replay of @entity15 \\'s \" cultural war \" speech , during which he told the @entity16 : \" we stand with ( @entity17 ) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women \" and later followed with \" there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the @entity18 itself . for this war is for the soul of @entity14 . \" progressives may enjoy watching @entity2 \\'s temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen. @entity19 of @entity20 , who has indicated a federal ban on same - sex marriage is not off the @entity8 table . and even if you think neither @entity2 nor @entity9 nor @entity19 will win the nomination , someone has to . in light of that , listen to conservative former @entity11 gov. @entity21 , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives \\' discomfort with same - sex marriage : \" it \\'s like asking someone who \\'s @entity22 to start serving bacon - wrapped shrimp in their deli . \" or @entity23 gov. @entity24 : \" i certainly will support @entity19 and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . \" or @entity25 gov. @entity26 , who has a long history of fighting against same - sex marriage and civil unions . and @entity27 said jail turns people gay , so there \\'s that . remember : @entity2 did n\\'t act alone . he only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials . in fact , according to the @entity28 , \" the @entity29 [ @entity30 ] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment . \" who supports , denounces @entity4 law ? @entity31 may suggest voters nationwide are more gay - friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we \\'re witnessing the final gasp of long - ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . former rep. @entity32 of @entity33 , the first member of @entity34 to marry someone of the same sex while in office , said he believes @entity8 want the @entity35 to rule in favor of same - sex marriage to provide political cover in the @entity8 primary . \" we \\'re winning , \" he told a crowd in @entity36 recently while promoting his latest book . i guess if you look at where the country was on @entity37 issues 10 years ago , we definitely are . that \\'s assuming you are part of the \" we \" who believe @entity37 people should have the same rights as their heterosexual / cisgender counterparts . but as the situation in @entity4 has shown , \" winning \" should not be mistaken for having \" won . \" for it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so - called \" religious freedom \" bills snaking through red - state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it \\'s raised in a debate or at a campaign stop , especially with @entity8 controlling both the @entity10 and the @entity38 . @entity2 , and to a lesser extent , @entity9 , may be toxic now but @entity14 has a short attention span . more importantly , they are not alone . @entity32 said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . if that holds true in 2016 , \" winning \" is going to feel very strange .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 gov. @entity2 signed a bill on friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable . nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen , @entity2 \\'s office said in a press release . @entity0 affiliate @entity3 says it \\'s never been used in an execution in the @entity4 . \" the person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later . in other words , a humane , quick and painless death , \" said rep. @entity5 , one of the bill \\'s authors , according to @entity3 . @entity6 , executive director of the @entity7 , told the @entity8 that the same \" painless \" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections . \" the hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which @entity1 has managed its execution process historically , \" he said . @entity1 \\'s executions have been put on hold while the @entity4 @entity9 reviews its use of lethal injections . last year , the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer @entity10 . @entity2 reaffirmed her support for the death penalty . \" @entity1 executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous , \" @entity2 said . \" i support that policy , and i believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty . the bill i signed today gives the state of @entity1 another death penalty option that meets that standard . \" the governor \\'s office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection , followed by nitrogen gas , the electric chair and the firing squad .',\n",

@entity2 conflict by proxy has reached @entity6 in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic . for @entity4 and its regional allies , the @entity2 military intervention in @entity6 -- \" @entity7 \" -- is the moment the @entity8 finally woke up to repel the expansion of @entity9 - @entity1 influence . for @entity3 and its regional allies -- including the @entity10 movement in @entity6 -- @entity2 \\'s actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable . and yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the @entity6 crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war . when @entity1 president @entity11 was elected in june 2013 , he pledged to reach out to @entity4 . he was up front and called @entity3 \\'s steep deterioration of relations with the @entity2 over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on @entity1 foreign policy . from @entity12 and @entity13 to @entity14 and the @entity15 , the @entity1 - @entity2 rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly . and yet despite @entity11 \\'s open pledge , profound differences over @entity16 and @entity17 in particular have kept @entity4 and @entity3 apart . but if the questions of @entity16 and @entity17 prevented a pause in hostilities , the @entity2 military intervention in @entity6 since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels . unlike in @entity16 and in @entity17 , the @entity2 military is now directly battling it out with @entity1 - backed rebels in @entity6 . while @entity4 no doubt exaggerates @entity3 \\'s role in the @entity6 crisis , its fingerprints are nonetheless evident . \" @entity1 provides financial support , weapons , training and intelligence to @entity10 , \" @entity18 , a @entity19 official and former @entity6 ambassador , told a congressional hearing last week . \" we believe that @entity1 sees opportunities with the @entity10 to expand its influence in @entity6 and threaten @entity2 and @entity20 @entity21 interests . \" the @entity1 find the charges biased and point to the @entity2 airstrikes in @entity6 as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor \\'s affairs . in @entity1 , the cue came from the country \\'s top authority , @entity22 ayatollah @entity23 , who has been unusually blunt . he tweeted : \" despite disputes , the @entity2 used to display composure [ with ] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure [ with ] barbarism . \" three days after @entity23 \\'s speech , @entity1 suspended religious pilgrimages to @entity24 . this came as news broke about two @entity1 teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting @entity2 . meanwhile , @entity25 protests have been staged in a number of @entity1 cities . @entity23 \\'s speech opened the floodgate of @entity25 statements . the voices of hardline figures in @entity3 have been the most agitated . general @entity26 , the commander of the @entity1 ground forces , taunted the @entity2 . \" beware of the day when firecrackers explode in @entity4 , \" @entity26 said , in a not -

time adversaries . and even though many @entity1 have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal , the leadership in @entity22 and @entity0 is far more skeptical . in a recent televised speech , @entity21 said it was possible that there would be no deal by the june 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all . and @entity1 \\'s army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites . meanwhile , the @entity23 has been confronted by a @entity24 that is largely hostile to the negotiations , and has been making the case that a deal can not be about trust , but about monitoring and verification . \" our main concern here is making sure that if @entity1 does n\\'t abide by its agreement , that we do n\\'t have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions , \" @entity4 president @entity25 said last friday . \" that \\'s our main concern . and i think that goal , of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation , that goal can be met . \" so far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week . but despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air , there is also fear that things could fall apart if @entity0 and @entity22 are n\\'t willing to make tough concessions .',\n",

       "  \"( @entity0 ) it 's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the @entity1 . after all , this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a @entity2 pilot alive . such moves are part of this murky group 's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information . so what can and should we make of the organization ? i explore the issue in depth in a special airing sunday night . and although it 's important to start with the caveat that @entity1 is indeed trying to scare and confuse us , i took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of @entity1 . first , @entity1 is clearly about religion -- its version of radical @entity3 -- but it is also about power . there is increasing evidence that the military backbone of @entity1 is made up not by a group of @entity1 zealots , but rather high - ranking officers from @entity4 's army -- baathists who were at least ostensibly secular . an internal @entity1 report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the @entity5 weekly @entity6 . that report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy , much like communism . but underneath it , much like communism , is simply a drive for control , a lust for power . next , @entity1 presents itself as a global organization , but it has thrived because of a local cause . the group has gained territory , cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the @entity7 of @entity8 and @entity9 , who believe they must fight the @entity10 to secure their own survival and strength . the reality is that that @entity7 cause is going to endure for some time . the @entity11 has been successful in its tactical battles against @entity1 and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in @entity8 . but the @entity7 of the region will remain in rebellion and the @entity7 - dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that @entity1 will be able to capitalize on this chaos . in the long run , @entity1 might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so - called caliphate . the few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by @entity1 suggest that , unsurprisingly , people do not like living under a brutal , theocratic dictatorship . they live in fear , and even those who chose it as an alternative to @entity10 rule are growing disenchanted . in this respect , @entity1 is like other radical @entity1 groups , such as the @entity12 -- they have an allure in the abstract , but once they are actually governing in their medieval , barbarous manner , the allure fades and the disenchantment builds . the result is ever - increasing repression . remember , no one has ever voted isis into power anywhere . the group simply slaughters its way to control . of course , one of the big questions has been : is @entity1 a threat to the @entity13 ? the group 's leaders declare that it is . but their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their @entity14 enemies , on building a caliphate in @entity8 and @entity9 . they understand , of course , that to be @entity15 no. 1 , they must battle the country that is the world 's no. 1 power -- the @entity11 . with that in mind , they seek such a confrontation and hope that the @entity11 will come to the @entity16 and fight them on their terms , on their terrain . still , while they are opportunists , and they ask and hope that their followers act in @entity11 , their main focus is not to come here -- they want @entity11 to go there . yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat @entity1 poses , the group has changed the nature of terror . the leaders of @entity1 have recognized that above all , they are a messaging machine , which in turn becomes a recruitment machine . this means that the key is not what happens on the ground , but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the @entity17 . and @entity1 does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn - off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web . the shock and awe they produce makes them go viral , and thus are seen by tens of millions . that ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world 's 1.6 billion @entity18 -- who seek revenge , glory and gore . unfortunately , as long as those young @entity18 men , scattered across the globe , are attracted to @entity1 and stream to its cause , the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month .\",\n",

wing \" socialism \" in the @entity15 , the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to @entity1 without much concern , even in the 2012 election . @entity8 populism ca n\\'t really work within the current campaign finance system . the enormous pressures for parties to raise funds in campaigns has for many decades created pressure on @entity1 , despite their political base , to court big donors . during the 1980s , @entity16 democrat @entity17 , serving as the chairman of the @entity18 and then as majority whip , made a strong appeal to savings and loans executives before the crash of the industry to catch up to @entity19 who had been outflanking them in raising money . the @entity1 were , and have continued to , losing their traditional base of campaign support -- organized labor -- which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s , providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns . without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing , many @entity1 concluded they needed business by their side . democrats running for president have made the same kind of choices . in 2008 , @entity14 disappointed many supporters upon becoming the first president to abandon the @entity20 public finance system for campaigns altogether , preferring to raise money himself for the general campaign . while small donors were enormously important to his victories , so too were business and @entity4 executives . at the height of the financial crash , when public sentiment had clearly turned against @entity4 , the administration agreed to a financial regulation bill ( @entity21 ) that was structured in such a way as to give powerful interests more than enough opportunity to limit the bite over the coming years . @entity4 , with an army of counsel , succeeded in eroding the impact of the legislation . not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices @entity1 can make , but it also greatly damages the party \\'s brand name . as the @entity22 reported , the scandal that might bring down @entity23 @entity8 sen. @entity24 is the first involving large scale super pac donations . at the heart of the story is almost $ 600,000 that physician @entity25 gave to @entity26 , possibly in exchange for favors . this is not simply some sort of accommodation of @entity1 to the corporate system . they do n\\'t have much of a choice . without these funds , they wo n\\'t be able to compete . in this election cycle , independent campaign donors are causing a huge stir . in conservative circles , the @entity27 brothers and their allies are throwing around enormous amounts of money to candidates who will support their deregulatory agenda . individual donors such as @entity28 gambling magnate @entity29 are causing ripples every time candidates speak , pressuring them to adjust their agenda . @entity1 have found their own magnates for political support , such as @entity30 and @entity31 . this is why campaign finance reform is so important , without @entity32 changing the fundamental dynamics , there wo n\\'t be much room for populism to thrive . even if @entity1 select someone like a @entity2 as their candidate or @entity5 decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy , there wo n\\'t be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts . the @entity8 needs @entity4 more than it needs to take a stand against @entity4 . those are the facts on the ground . if @entity1 really want to take on @entity4 and tackle economic inequality , they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system . if campaigns were publicly funded or there were more stringent limits on independent expenditures , @entity4 would have much more trouble achieving disproportionate influence . reform could level the playing field . more often than not , campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support . a more populist economic agenda that revolved around progressive taxation and substantial public assistance to strengthen the middle class can only work in a different kind of political system . if things stay the same , @entity1 can only continue to win elections by turning to their corporate and financial base of support .',\n",

       "  '@entity0 ( @entity1 ) @entity2 is more than ready for @entity3 . the former secretary of state confirmed on sunday what the political world has expected for months -- eight years after her first failed @entity4 bid , @entity5 will once again seek the @entity6 \\'s nomination for president . \" i \\'m hitting the road to earn your vote , because it \\'s your time , \" @entity5 said in a video released sunday afternoon officially kicking off her campaign . \" and i hope you \\'ll join me on this journey . \" as @entity5 sets off onto the campaign trail to reintroduce herself to voters and court donors across the country , @entity2 elites are ready to roll out the red carpet . but while the enthusiastic support from the industry will be a financial boon for @entity5 \\'s newly launched campaign , it will also pose a delicate balancing act when it comes to appeasing a vocal wing of her party that is antagonistic toward the banking sector . @entity5 , 67 , has long enjoyed a close relationship with the financial industry . as a @entity0 senator for almost a decade , she represented @entity2 and courted the industry aggressively during her last presidential campaign . and there is a certain degree of nostalgia within the industry for her husband \\'s two - term presidency , marked by the 1990s bull market and broad financial deregulation , including the repeal of the @entity7 , which separated commercial banking from riskier investing activities . now @entity5 \\'s allies in the finance world are eager to galvanize a broad network of potential donors in @entity0 and beyond . many on @entity2 and in the broader business community view her as a dependable , business - friendly force within a @entity6 that has grown increasingly populist during president @entity8 \\'s time in office . @entity9 , the former ceo of @entity10 and a close @entity8 associate who will back @entity5 in 2016 , said there \\'s an \" incredible amount of enthusiasm \" for her campaign to get off the ground . \" we know the secretary from the years of being first lady to the senator to the secretary , so we have decades of working relationship with her , \" @entity9 , who now runs a boutique consulting firm headquartered in @entity11 , told @entity1 . \" i do n\\'t think it \\'s surprising that the former senator of @entity0 is close to the finance community . \" @entity5 friend and prominent @entity6 fundraiser @entity12 , who founded the venture capital firm @entity13 , said @entity5 has \" an enormous following \" both inside and outside of the finance world . \" there are a lot of people who perhaps did n\\'t know her as well before who are all set to jump on the bandwagon , \" @entity12 said . as compared with 2008 , he added : \" there is no diminishment , just the opposite -- an acceleration of interest in her running for the presidency . \" but the fanfare wo n\\'t sit well with everyone . the former first lady \\'s perceived coziness with @entity2 is a source of irritation for liberal activists , who hope to push the eventual @entity6 nominee to embrace progressive ideals during the 2016 primaries . @entity5 , who lost her first presidential campaign to a challenger from the left , seems to recognize that the liberal wing of the party has grown even more vocal and influential since then , especially on economic matters . her video message on sunday centered on the theme of upward mobility and an economic recovery that has left some behind . \" @entity14 have fought their way back from tough economic times , but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top , \" @entity5 said , vowing to be a \" champion \" of \" everyday @entity14 . \" that statement tracks closely with her tone in recent public appearances , where the former secretary has been hitting on populist economic themes . she has taken on a range of issues that most appeal to liberals , such as the wealth gap , minimum wage and equal pay , in the months leading up to her announcement . in january , she took to social media to defend the 2010 @entity15 @entity2 reform law , which contains provisions that the industry has tried to roll back . \" attacking financial reform is risky and wrong , \" she wrote on @entity16 . @entity17 , a longtime @entity5 ally and former @entity8 chief of staff , said @entity5 has to reintroduce herself to the party . if she defends policies viewed as having contributed to the financial crisis , @entity17 said , \" that \\'s a problem . \" he continued : \" my guess is she \\'ll have enough policy positions that says she \\'s not in the tank with them . \" @entity5 \\'s early gestures have not satisfied some activists , who point to @entity18 @entity6 sen. @entity19 as their candidate of choice . several liberal groups have even launched a formal draft campaign to elevate the senator and highlight her progressive views . former @entity20 @entity21 sen. @entity22 , who served as head of the @entity23 , said part of @entity5 \\'s challenge stems from the fact that \" the center of the @entity6 has moved very much to the left . \" \" @entity3 has always been much more rational on these issues and much more mainstream , \" @entity22 said . \" i presume she \\'s going to get the nomination , but she may be contested from the left . \" while @entity24 has shown no interest in running for president this cycle , other democrats have been taking aim at big banks as they tour the early presidential states . former @entity25 gov. @entity26 , former @entity27 sen. @entity28 and @entity29 sen. @entity30 , an independent who caucuses with @entity6 , are all testing the waters . they have made economic populism central to their potential campaigns , proposing to crack down on the banking sector , reform the culture on @entity2 and toughen financial regulations . none of these potential candidates will be able to compete with @entity5 \\'s extensive fundraising apparatus . but their presence in the race could exert pressure on @entity5 to embrace progressive policies . after @entity5 \\'s announcement sunday , a collection of liberal activists declared that the former secretary of state must prove her progressive bona fides. \" we look forward to @entity3 and other candidates laying out their platforms and hearing whether they embrace the fights that sen. @entity24 has spent her life leading , \" said @entity24 campaign manager @entity31 . \" in the coming days , @entity32 will be stepping up our efforts to convince @entity24 to run for president . \" now that she is a formally declared candidate , political strategists expect @entity5 to be more outspoken , laying out her economic priorities quickly and in her own terms . @entity6 strategist @entity33 downplayed the notion of @entity5 - @entity24 tension in the @entity6 , predicting that with @entity5 as an announced candidate , \" she \\'ll offer a pretty compelling rationale \" for her campaign . @entity33 , who worked in @entity34 \\'s administration , said he envisioned an economic message for @entity5 anchored in her biography : \" i grew up in the @entity35 in a middle class family , i understand the challenges that they face , we need to make sure that @entity14 gives people a fair shot . \" despite @entity5 \\'s embrace of more populist rhetoric , finance and business leaders are n\\'t too concerned that she will back policies that are anathema to them . they expect that she will be able to articulate a broad economic goals aimed at the middle class rather than one that rails against bailouts and financial excess , particularly as the country gets more distance from the last financial crisis . @entity36 , president of the @entity37 , a prominent business coalition , predicted that @entity5 would be able to maintain her relationship with @entity2 without alienating the liberal base . the fact that @entity5 \" is knowledgeable and maintains good , open relationships with the business and financial world does not suggest that she \\'s in anybody \\'s pocket , \" @entity36 said . \" she \\'s demonstrated that she \\'s an independent force . \"',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) this article contains language that may be offensive to some . since the news broke last weekend that @entity1 had declared her candidacy , notable among the blitz of news stories are the many that refer to her as the mononymous \" @entity1 , \" as if she were a pop star in a pantsuit . the @entity2 published an item titled \" @entity3 backs @entity1 for president \" while gossip site @entity4 refers to the former @entity5 , @entity6 senator , and secretary of state on a first - name basis throughout its news story on the announcement . even @entity7 posted a piece about the run called \" there \\'s nothing inevitable about @entity1 . \" she \\'s famous enough by now to go by one name , but should she ? while @entity8 is arguably more widely known than any of her to - date opponents , she \\'s also a former @entity6 senator and secretary of state . she \\'s not @entity9 . and yet , despite her decorated career in government , we \\'ve long called @entity8 by her first name , and her first name only , in a way we do n\\'t do with men who have held similar , or even vaguely similar , positions of power . according to a @entity10 study , @entity8 was called by her first name four times more than her 2008 rival , @entity11 , and so it goes this time around . after all , @entity12 \\'s also running for president . so is @entity13 . when those guys declared , however , they got headlines that included their last names . there \\'s a very good reason for that . presidential candidates are not just professionals , but professionals declaring their candidacy for a position that many consider to be the most powerful in the world . a position that not only deserves formality and respect , but within a global context seems to require it . being president of the @entity6 is a serious job . are there \" @entity14 \" signs in our future ? unlikely . were we encouraged to \" @entity15 \" ? nope . the @entity16 , meanwhile , is one of the most regimented organizations in the world , whose values put dignity and respect at top priority . cadets do n\\'t call their commanding officers by their first names , even -- maybe especially -- if they \\'re women . so why are we all referring to the possible next commander - in - chief as if we \\'re part of her circle of close pals ? before you point to the fact that @entity8 is not the first @entity8 to cross this particular political threshold , the issue at hand is not one of practicality : the @entity6 public is smart enough to distinguish between this @entity8 and that @entity8 . @entity17 was n\\'t the first in his family to run for office , and when he did , legitimate newspapers did n\\'t go around noting the \" w \" ( or even \" @entity17 \" ) was up for the job . he was just @entity17 , as he should have been , just as @entity8 is just @entity8 , a woman who has done a very good job distinguishing herself from her husband without the need to be referred to by her first name in order to avoid a case of mistaken identity . of course , the mononymity does n\\'t seem to be unwelcome : sections of @entity8 \\'s website invite readers to \" like @entity18 \" and read about \" @entity19 , \" while the campaign \\'s official hashtag appears to be # @entity20 . her campaign chairman reportedly emailed potential campaign donors yesterday with the missive that \" it \\'s official : @entity1 \\'s running for president . \" perhaps @entity8 and her advisers believe the single name makes her more personable , and familiar . maybe it \\'s an effort to distance @entity8 from the other gender - based stereotype slapped on her the last time around , when she was \" the bitch \" to @entity21 \\'s \" ditz . \" but while we should like our president -- if not desire to have her as a personal friend -- it \\'s far more important to trust , and respect , her -- and that still requires a level of formality . it \\'s important for the @entity6 public to be able to imagine electing a leader not despite the fact that she \\'s a woman , or even because she \\'s a woman , but who , very simply , happens to be a woman . whether she endorses the idea or not , calling @entity8 by her first name serves to , at best , reinforce gender and workplace stereotypes -- that women need to be \" approachable , \" not abrasive or aloof , in order to get the job done and be liked while doing it -- and at worst , infantilize and put her in her place . there \\'s a reason , after all , that we address current and former presidents as mr. president when we meet them , and not \" hey , @entity22 ! \" and if there \\'s a reason @entity1 will be elected as our next president , it \\'s not because she let us call her @entity1 .',\n",
       "  '@entity0 ( @entity1 ) with the world watching , in his historic address to a joint session of the @entity2 , the first ever by a @entity3 prime minister , @entity4 surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history . during this 70th year anniversary of the end of @entity5 , @entity4 has been disappointing on @entity3 \\'s wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for @entity3 \\'s wartime actions in @entity6 where the bitter legacies remain divisive . and this \" @entity7 \" is harmful to @entity3 \\'s international image , riles @entity8 and @entity9 and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda . @entity10 deliberately set the bar on history very low for @entity4 because the @entity11 administration is more focused on the shared perception with @entity0 that contemporary @entity8 is a threat requiring a collective response . strengthening the alliance with @entity3 and sealing the deal on the @entity12 trumps past misdeeds . forty years after the fall of @entity13 , and in the wake of @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity16 is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds . president @entity11 pulled out all the stops to give @entity4 a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling @entity10 \\'s longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined . but the newly expanded security role embraced by @entity3 enjoys little support among @entity3 . as a recent @entity17 indicates , only 23 % are in favor while 68 % are opposed . it is also problematic that @entity4 \\'s stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with @entity9 , something the @entity16 sees as essential . carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience , @entity4 hit the right notes in many respects , and even inched forward on history . he did express \" eternal condolences \" about the loss of @entity16 lives in @entity5 , and noted , \" enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit . \" that is welcome news , but @entity3 has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies , precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past . many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories , but @entity4 is mounting a significant retreat from @entity3 \\'s repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid- 1990s , and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education . he is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship . of course there is nothing that @entity4 could say that would satisfy @entity8 or @entity9 , two nations that suffered longest and most from @entity3 depredations from the late 19th century . but that does n\\'t mean he should n\\'t try a bit harder . what @entity4 said is , \" post war , we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war . our actions brought suffering to the peoples in @entity18 countries . we must not avert our eyes from that . i will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard . \" essentially outsourcing \" apology and war responsibility \" to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale . it is also troubling that throughout his political career , @entity4 has worked to undermine and repudiate previous @entity19 . rather than merely \" upholding \" what others have said it might have been better for @entity4 to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology . in @entity3 , there has been a lot of pressure on @entity4 to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 @entity20 that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility . even the conservative @entity21 newspaper urged him to do so . @entity22 clearly condemned \" mistaken national policy , \" \" self - righteous nationalism , \" \" colonial rule \" and \" aggression , \" but @entity4 has spent his entire political career renouncing this so - called \" masochistic \" view of @entity3 \\'s wartime history . fatalistically , @entity4 said , \" history is harsh . what is done can not be undone . \" well , yes that is self - evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies , acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates @entity3 in @entity6 . @entity4 is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering @entity3 on the anvil of history , but they were handed the hammer by @entity3 . given @entity4 \\'s evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery , a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards . what @entity4 managed , however , was even weaker than expected : \" armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most . in our age , we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses . \" this cavalier \" sh * t happens \" attitude towards the comfort women system undermines @entity3 \\'s dignity and represents a step backward . in recent remarks @entity4 says he upholds the 1993 @entity23 statement , but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment . moreover , @entity4 \\'s support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools , contravening what the @entity23 statement promised . in the only textbook that does mention them , the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman \\'s testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence . to counter criticism , @entity4 now refers to @entity3 \\'s comfort women system in terms of human trafficking , a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns . human trafficking , however , highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the @entity3 military and government authorities of the day . revisionists prefer to blame the @entity9 brokers , but they were acting at the behest of @entity3 officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell . in his speech @entity4 also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom . this too is welcome news because over the past year @entity4 has presided over an orchestrated attack on the @entity24 newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system , packed @entity25 \\'s management with like - minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs . indeed the @entity26 ran an article on april 26 implicating @entity27 in the axing of a prominent tv pundit who made the mistake of criticizing @entity4 . the foreign press has also exposed @entity3 government harassment targeting their reporting , especially regarding the whitewashing of history , and attempts to smear the integrity of those who would n\\'t go along . in addition , journalists were told not to interview certain @entity4 critics . journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in @entity3 for some time , but under @entity4 the rules of engagement appear to be nastier . @entity4 got lots of applause from @entity16 politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an \" alliance of hope . \" that \\'s not exactly how @entity28 feel about the disproportionate base -

       "  '( @entity0 ) just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , @entity1 channels , even social media platforms like @entity2 and @entity3 -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media . it is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence , though that in itself is liberating . it is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online . it is not unique to @entity4 , but it might seem more pronounced if you live there . going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard . but it still brings resistance , some of it legal , some of it deadly . let \\'s look at the legal angle first . @entity5 , the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail sunday in @entity6 , drew international attention for his @entity7 harangue . but jailing critics is not usually the government \\'s first choice in @entity6 . it is part of @entity8 \\'s legacy that the government \\'s use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases , usually carrying heavy financial penalties , is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices . his father has reportedly apologized for his son \\'s behavior , but the younger @entity5 could face up to three years in jail . @entity5 is not unique . another dissident blogger in @entity6 , @entity9 , continues to suffer financial and legal pressure , including the loss of his job , because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city - state \\'s prime minister , @entity10 , of corruption . @entity9 \\'s concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the @entity11 , the government \\'s compulsory pension program . @entity5 and @entity9 are two of many . the @entity12 \\' file on @entity6 going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases , some against politicians , others against citizens simply frustrated with their government . but it is not just @entity6 where internet activity comes under fire : on monday in @entity13 , with much less of the international attention heaped on @entity5 , five editors and executives from @entity14 were arrested over the site \\'s march 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the @entity15 , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under @entity16 law . in deeply @entity17 @entity13 , questions of @entity16 faith are a third - rail issue , as is revealing government decisions before they are announced . by far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is @entity18 , where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers , most of them @entity19 or @entity20 activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism . but in second place in @entity4 is @entity21 , where @entity12 \\'s most recent prison census showed @entity21 holding 16 reporters behind bars as of december 1 . add one more in late december , @entity22 , a prominent blogger who was arrested for \" law - violating \" after police searched his home in southern @entity23 on december 27 , and two more in january , @entity24 and @entity25 , arrested on anti-state charges of \" abusing democratic freedoms \" and you can see the pattern . because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in @entity21 . only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in @entity21 , their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013 . both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage . the list could go on , but the reality is that , as @entity12 wrote in 2013 , across @entity4 \" governments have curtailed @entity26 freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices , including prohibitive laws , heightened surveillance and censorship , and threats of imprisonment on various national security - related offenses . \" that is still the policy path being followed by most countries in @entity4 , and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon . jailing journalists is one thing , but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another . since 1992 , 11 % of journalists killed have died for their work online . because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the @entity26 , that proportion can be expected to grow . while most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers , @entity27 has recently become the exception . on monday , @entity28 was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in @entity27 in the past five weeks . @entity29 and his wife , @entity30 , were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting @entity31 . @entity29 , a @entity32 citizen of @entity27 origin , was killed and his wife was critically injured . both @entity33 and @entity29 had written critically on @entity16 matters . the blogger death toll gets higher in @entity27 if you go back a year or two , and religious beliefs are always involved , and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity . in january 2013 , blogger @entity34 , who wrote critical commentary on religion , @entity35 groups , free speech , and human rights , barely survived after he was stabbed by @entity16 . in february 2013 , blogger @entity36 , who had written about @entity16 fundamentalism and @entity35 groups , was hacked to death by members of an @entity35 militant group , according to police investigations . later in 2013 , @entity35 groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy . while arrests were made after those murders , there have been no convictions . the bottom line : online journalists , operating outside the restraints of mainstream media , have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors . where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom . where the rule of law is weak , they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom , if ever , answer to the rule of law .',\n",

degree threshold in a 1977 ( 1977 ! ) paper titled \" economic growth and climate : the @entity9 . \" the estimate was \" crude , but it was a reasonable first start , \" he told me . \" if there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature , this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years , \" he wrote in \" @entity10 . \" a growing body of research now supports the idea . science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming . and that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2 - degree world is something none of us should want . \" you need a judgment call for these things , \" said @entity11 , chair of the @entity12 , who has written on the history of 2 degrees @entity1 . \" and this 2 - degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy . \" @entity13 was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal , @entity11 told me . that happened in the 1990s . later came the @entity14 , the @entity15 , the @entity16 and , most significantly , the @entity17 , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much . the @entity18 was among the signatories . i \\'m going to spend the month of may exploring this question , so look for more on this . but here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post- 2 - degree world to look like . these are pulled from reports by the @entity19 , the @entity20 and the @entity21 . wildfires in the @entity18 are expected to increase 400 % to 800 % in size . hurricanes are expected to become 2 % to 8 % more intense . a range of species will be at risk for extinction , particularly amphibians . the @entity20 estimates 20 % to 30 % of animals and plants species will be at \" increasingly high risk of extinction \" at or near the 2 - degree mark . the @entity22 is expected keep melting , losing 30 % of its annual average sea ice . certain crop yields in the @entity18 , @entity23 and @entity24 are expected to decrease 10 % to 30 % . the availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20 % . so ... not good . and numbers do n\\'t convey the emotional toll . \" i \\'m from @entity25 , \" said @entity7 , the economist who proposed the 2 - degree threshold . \" i love it there , and i know it \\'s going to be a completely different climate . the trout fishing probably wo n\\'t be as good . the hiking wo n\\'t be as good . these forests may look completely different , or burn down . i love to ski . it \\'s one of my things i love most . and that \\'s obviously affected by warming . i love the ocean , and the @entity26 coastline , and it \\'s in peril . that \\'s just for starters . \" no one knows , exactly . think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk . @entity27 , a climate scientist at @entity28 , told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking . how many cigarettes give you cancer ? no one knows , exactly . but the more you smoke , the more you up your risk . and 2 degrees , policy experts agree , is certainly risky territory . plus , everyone hates a fraction . targeting 1 degree of warming is \" ridiculous because you ca n\\'t do it , \" said @entity7 , the economist . \" three sounds too high . and you ca n\\'t have a fraction because it \\'s too complicated . \" so two is kind of an obvious number . \" the climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the @entity29 . and we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we \\'re already putting into the atmosphere , even with \" very ambitious mitigation action \" to reduce carbon emissions , according to a 2014 report from the @entity21 . some of that warming is \" locked - in to the @entity30 \\'s atmospheric system , \" that organization says . the impacts of climate change already are being felt . yes , but it wo n\\'t be easy . \" if you want to stay below 2 degrees , you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree , \" said @entity11 from the @entity12 . here \\'s the best guess for what that \" amazing speed \" might need to look like : cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80 % to 90 % by 2050 , said @entity31 , global director of the climate program at the @entity32 . \" it depends on how much risk you want to accept , \" she said . some activists , including those from 350.org and @entity33 , which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in @entity34 , want to accept less risk than that . \" our position is 100 % clean energy , \" said @entity35 , a senior campaigner for @entity33 . if we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate , we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury . scarier still , we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100 . some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2 - degree target , saying it \\'s too ambitious , or even naive . but we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that \" north star \" to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem . if you think 2 degrees sounds bad , 5 degrees is far , far worse . the @entity20 expects a 5 - degree world to be characterized by \" major extinctions around the globe \" and a \" reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide . \" just beyond that , at 6 degrees , we \\'re looking a \" catastro - f * * * \" that would be almost \" infinitely costly , \" said @entity2 , the @entity3 economist . \" it \\'s akin to killing the planet , basically . or society on the planet . \" this much should be clear : something has to change . if we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3 , that \\'s still better ( or less awful ) than 5 or 6 . what \\'s important is that we maintain a sense of urgency , and keep sight of the goal . please be in touch ! i need your help to make this work . email questions to : climate ( at ) cnn ( dot ) com . subscribe to the \" 2 degrees \" newsletter . follow the project on @entity5 , @entity36 and @entity37 .',\n",
       "  '@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) before \" @entity3 \" duo , @entity4 and @entity5 , the last @entity1 executed for drug offenses abroad was @entity6 by @entity7 in 2005 . although @entity0 then , as it is now , was strongly opposed to the death penalty , @entity6 \\'s death did not harm @entity1 \\'s relationship with @entity7 , nor the @entity1 people \\'s view of that country . the executions of @entity4 and @entity5 early wednesday morning will be a different story . their deaths will result in short to medium term frictions between @entity0 and @entity8 at the highest levels . however , this will soon ease as the two countries have a number of common interests that neither side can abandon . but the @entity1 public \\'s view of @entity9 , and anger with its government , will take much longer to subside . those sympathetic to the dilemma faced by @entity9 \\'s president @entity10 will argue that he was politically bound to allow the executions to take place . he ran on a robust anti-drug campaign , arguing that 18,000 @entity9 die from illicit drugs each year , though those figures are widely disputed . as the saga over whether the executions would take place dragged on for months , following ever more desperate legal challenges from the defense teams , @entity10 painted himself into a corner . the widespread @entity1 perception is that the president owed his power to @entity11 and former president @entity12 . believed by many to be the most powerful person in the country , some suggest that @entity12 insisted @entity10 stand by his hard - line anti-drugs policy and stare down @entity1 pressure -- or lose her support and reputation as a firm leader in the process . as recently as last year , it seemed that @entity1 prime minister @entity13 empathized with the underlying pressures and back - room obligations on leaders . while working assiduously behind the scenes to argue for clemency for the \" @entity3 \" duo , @entity13 nevertheless appeared to accept the inevitability of the executions , even as he publicly reiterated @entity1 \\'s opposition to capital punishment . such a softly — softly approach was also aided by an @entity1 public that did not seem overly interested in the plight of @entity4 and @entity5 . all that changed when credible stories began to emerge about the rehabilitation of the two @entity1 prisoners : @entity4 becoming a pastor and respected religious example for his fellow prisoners and @entity5 a passionate painter with impressive talent . such was the regard held for the @entity1 duo that even the governor of the @entity14 jail where they were kept , @entity15 , urged a reconsideration of their impending executions . as the duo attracted greater public sympathy -- including from a joint statement by the last six prime ministers urging @entity8 to reconsider -- the good , great and popular in @entity1 society also united behind the plea for mercy . under increasing pressure in the polls , the @entity13 government began to publicly pursue what it had been doing in private : urging a stay of execution on legal and moral grounds -- even once reminding @entity8 of the over $ 1 billion worth of aid that @entity9 has received from @entity1 over the past decade . @entity1 have a dim view of how @entity9 has responded . while @entity8 and many @entity9 people viewed this as typical posturing and moral grandstanding from a developed @entity16 neighbor , @entity1 began to once again see @entity9 in an unattractive light -- when it was so recently upheld as the shining example of a rising democracy in @entity17 . the hard - line stance of @entity10 was seen as the heartless and self - interested actions of a weak and inexperienced president attempting to establish his authority -- at the expense of rehabilitated @entity1 lives . credible accusations by the defense attorney for the two @entity1 that a lighter sentence was denied to them because of their incapacity to pay the bribe demanded of them from the sentencing judges affirmed perceptions of @entity9 \\'s judicial system as corrupt if not incompetent . particularly galling for the @entity18 government and @entity1 was @entity10 \\'s refusal to even accept a phone call from @entity13 to discuss the issue , and the wall of silence and non-engagement that confronted @entity1 ministers attempting to plead the case with @entity9 counterparts . perhaps the final straw was @entity9 \\'s decision to deploy hundreds of commandos and four naval ships to transport the handcuffed prisoners from @entity19 to their island for execution -- viewed in @entity1 as a deliberate backhander by @entity8 to @entity0 . the @entity13 government had warned of unspecified consequences should the executions take place , and on wednesday morning announced the unprecedented recall of @entity1 \\'s ambassador to @entity9 . there are unlikely to be any ministerial visits between the two countries for many months , if not the rest of the year . while @entity1 is not likely to withdraw aid to @entity9 , @entity0 will also ensure that it offers @entity8 no special favors in the immediate future . given the degree of ongoing cooperation on important issues , such as terrorism , money laundering and drug trafficking , @entity1 and @entity9 will continue to work together behind the scenes at the operational levels . @entity1 will also need ongoing @entity9 cooperation to stem the flow of illegal boat arrivals to @entity1 shores and will not want to jeopardize what has already been achieved . for these reasons , the fallout between capitals will be contained . but while the @entity9 public appears divided as to whether their government acted wisely , the @entity1 public is united that @entity8 did not . this means that for them , and even as a democracy , the older images of @entity9 as a corrupt , immature and unpredictable neighbor will return . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .',\n",

based violence is at epidemic levels in @entity2 and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide . according to the @entity4 , two women are killed there every day . there are many reasons why , beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country \\'s 36 - year - old civil war . during the conflict , atrocities were committed against women , who were used as a weapon of war . in 1996 , a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government . but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror , due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination . military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions . many remain in power , and they have not changed the way they view women . some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades - long conflict , most of them from indigenous @entity5 populations . nearly 20 years later , according to the @entity6 , levels of violent crime are higher in @entity2 than they were during the war . but despite the high homicide rate , the @entity4 estimates 98 % of cases never make it to court . women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep - rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny . in many cases , femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war , including rape , torture and mutilation . @entity7 drug cartels , organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness . authorities investigating drug - related killings are stretched thin , leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides . in many cases , crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation . many consider the @entity8 , or @entity9 , corrupt , under - resourced and ineffective . even if a case does get prosecuted , according to @entity10 , the country \\'s weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence . perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in @entity2 is the country \\'s deeply rooted patriarchal society . according to @entity11 , the representative of @entity4 women in @entity2 , \" 80 % of men believe that women need permission to leave the house , and 70 % of women surveyed agreed . \" this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence . rights groups say machismo not only condones violence , it places the blame on the victim . the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize . \" politicians do n\\'t think women are important , \" says former secretary general of the @entity12 for women @entity13 . \" political parties use women for elections . they give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor . \" lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty . many girls , especially in indigenous communities do n\\'t go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far . @entity13 says \" they are subject to rape , violence and forced participation in the drug trade . \" although the situation for girls and women in @entity2 is alarming , there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing . with the help of an organization known as @entity14 , or @entity15 , @entity1 was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved . he is now spending 27 years behind bars . @entity1 is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art. since 2008 , she and four other abuse survivors known as @entity16 , or \" @entity17 , \" have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories . the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly , but it also offers suggestions for change . and it \\'s having an impact . women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support . men are reacting , too . one of the main characters , @entity18 , says during one presentation , a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated . he said he wanted to be different . the taboo topic of gender -

leaders and civil rights activists accused of using excessive force and inflaming an already tense situation in protests that flared sporadically from august through the end of the year . the @entity2 \\'s language , contained in internal mission briefings obtained through a @entity5 request , is intensifying the concerns of some who objected to the police officers \\' actions in putting down riots . they broke out after the august 9 shooting of unarmed black teenager @entity6 by city police officer @entity7 . a grand jury declined to indict @entity7 in the case . \" it \\'s disturbing when you have what amounts to @entity8 soldiers viewing @entity8 citizens somehow as the enemy , \" said @entity9 , an alderman in @entity10 . the documents obtained by @entity1 also detail that the @entity2 was concerned about perceptions of its deployment , with superiors later telling troops to stop using heavily militarized language to describe protesters . and the communications show them calibrating the timing of their deployment in november -- in anticipation of the @entity11 grand jury \\'s decision on whether to indict @entity7 -- to try to ensure that their presence did n\\'t further dial up tensions , though several community members voiced concern that they were not deployed quickly enough . \" we are deliberately constraining mobilization timelines to the last couple days to minimize

this article appeared , @entity14 insisted that \" while the term \\' enemy forces \\' appears in a handful of early drafts of the operations order it was also clear that as soon as leadership saw the language , they correctly identified it as being inappropriate for this type of mission \" and claimed that the language was changed \" well ahead of the grand jury \\'s decision . \" but internal

based bombs -- the so - called \" @entity27 \" plot -- @entity1 law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide . according to @entity24 , after the tipoff , @entity1 investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were . all they had to go on was the surveillance footage . the woman was fully veiled and her male companion was blurry in the tape , so they did not immediately know who they were . but in early to mid-april they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couple \\'s radical ties . according to @entity24 , @entity1 police established that the couple had recently traveled to @entity28 , where they met with members of @entity29 , a radical pro-jihadist group linked to @entity30 in the @entity31 . @entity28 police had monitored the meeting in @entity28 . they also established that the couple had links to radicals who had gone to fight with @entity32 , @entity33 \\'s @entity34 affiliate and they found the couple were in contact with a young radical islamist from @entity2 who had gone to fight in @entity35 at the end of last year and was recently killed . the pipe bomb that was recovered by police appears to have similarities to devices built by @entity36 bombers @entity37 . @entity5 said the device recovered near @entity2 included nails as shrapnel . the @entity4 bombers downloaded instructions from a recipe in @entity38 magazine , an online @entity39 language magazine put out by @entity33 in @entity40 , which has also been translated into @entity1 and other languages . in august 2013 , the @entity31 security agency @entity41 revealed to @entity42 \\'s intelligence and security committee that @entity38 has been \" read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the @entity31 since its first issue ( in 2010 ) . we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots . \" like other @entity43 countries , @entity1 is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of its citizens who have traveled to @entity35 and @entity44 . in recent years there has been growing concern over radicalization in @entity1 \\'s large @entity20 diaspora community . travel to @entity35 is particularly easy for individuals of @entity20 descent because @entity20 is the entry point for most foreign fighters traveling to @entity35 . according to @entity24 , almost 700 @entity1 are believed to have traveled to @entity35 and @entity44 , with up to 90 % joining @entity45 . one - third of these have returned to @entity1 and 70 to 80 have been killed in the fighting in @entity35 and @entity44 . there has only been one fatal terrorist attack in @entity1 since 9/11 -- the shooting death of two @entity26 airmen outside @entity46 by a lone -

let me explain . both high fructose corn syrup and sugar in the @entity4 are largely made from genetically modified crops : 95 % of the sugar beets grown in the @entity4 are @entity5 , as is 88 % percent of the corn . those crops are engineered to withstand spraying of the @entity6 herbicide @entity7 . last month the @entity8 declared the key ingredient , @entity9 , a probable carcinogen . canola oil , another cookie ingredient , is also of concern : 90 % of rape seed ( from which canola is produced ) is @entity5 , too . suddenly those cookies seem less benign , do n\\'t they ? if that is n\\'t enough to dampen your cravings , recent studies have found a causal link between sugar and heart disease . and trans fats have been well documented to increase the risk of heart disease . a few years ago , this was a big story , and most products now boast that they have zero trans fats . in reality , companies are allowed to claim \" zero \" on the label if a serving contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fats . but often we eat more than one serving — do you really stop at two cookies ? -- so rather than zero , your actual intake can be several grams . adding to the confusion , on the ingredient label , transfats show up as partially hydrogenated oils , including in @entity10 , @entity3 , @entity11 , and other popular @entity10 . clearly the @entity12 \\' leadership knows of the dangers ; they actively advertise on the boxes and web site those cookies contain \" zero grams trans fat per serving . \" \" you might be thinking , \\' wow ! i \\'m glad dr. @entity13 was n\\'t my mom ! \" but my kids will tell you i love a good dessert . in fact , i make a mean cheesecake . an occasional home - baked cookie is not going to ruin a kid \\'s health . the problem is bigger than cookies . there is too little conversation on the hazards of sugar , white flour , gmos , and trans fats from those whom you would expect to call them out : physicians . perhaps this is not so surprising . after all , pediatricians , whose job is to protect the health of children , have a sum total of zero hours of required nutrition education in their residencies . nor do residency review committees require internists , family physicians or cardiologists to learn nutrition . and yet , there is compelling evidence that a diet rich in vegetables and fruit , whole grains , fish , nuts , and moderate amounts of dairy and alcohol , as well as avoiding smoking , obesity -- and exercising 30 minutes a day -- lowers overall mortality by 65 % . similar results were found in the study published under the name \" @entity14 is the @entity15 \" , which showed that eating a healthy diet ( fruits , vegetables , beans , whole grains , nuts , seeds , and low meat consumption ) would prevent 78 % of chronic disease , 93 % of diabetes , 81 % of heart attacks , 50 % of strokes and 36 % of all cancers . at the @entity16 for @entity17 , where i serve as executive director , we are seeking to remedy this . we include nutrition in all our training programs and have a new , 100 - hour online course that is being pilot - tested at five pediatric residencies including @entity18 , universities of @entity19 , @entity20 , and @entity21 , and @entity22 . we also run an annual nutrition and health conference to address nutrition education for physicians in practice . educating doctors will not be enough . parents and schools have a role to play as well . and the @entity12 , with their enormous reach and influence , could do their part and choose a new fundraising item . times change and our traditions evolve . what if , this spring , the girls sold fresh fruit and vegetables , tomato plants or flowers , or even pedometers ?

@entity2 trade . the binational ties are strong and have remained strong , \" @entity5 says . \" yes , we had a really difficult time for a ... period . @entity1 was at one time the deadliest city in the world . \" @entity5 speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men , women and children were killed indiscriminately . many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence . others were victims of the drug turf war . it was n\\'t that long ago , @entity5 says , that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into @entity1 . \" ( now ) i travel to @entity1 regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go . i always feel safe and secure . \" a spokesman for the @entity9 state attorney general \\'s office told @entity0 that at one point , there were days when @entity1 had more than 20 killings . \" that was normal , \" spokesman @entity10 told @entity0 . \" it \\'s safer now . \" the numbers from the attorney general \\'s office seem to bear that out . more than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago , but so far this year there have been 89 killings , according to @entity10 -- a dramatic decrease in the violence . \" undoubtedly , the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions , and specifically the local police , helped . there was a coordinated effort between agencies , \" @entity10 said . \" without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city . \" the government cleaned up corruption within the local police force , and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels . another factor that may have helped : the turf war between the @entity1 and @entity11 cartels essentially ended , with the @entity12 claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in @entity1 . @entity5 argues that the @entity7 - @entity1 border is \" safer than it \\'s ever been . \" he cites the \" 30 million lawful crosses from @entity7 into @entity1 \" last year as a symbolic step . yet there are those who do n\\'t want to celebrate too soon . \" for @entity1 to be considered a safe city , there \\'s a long way to go , \" says @entity13 , executive director for @entity14 , an independent organization that works to improve the city \\'s quality of life . \" just this past year ( in 2014 ) there were 424 homicides . in 2007 , there were 272 . yes , we \\'re not as bad . but we \\'re still very sick , \" @entity13 told @entity0 from his office in @entity1 . \" in reality , we \\'re progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity . we \\'re still working out the corruption in the city . it \\'s still an issue here . \" with more than 40 % of @entity1 living below the poverty line , according to @entity14 , the future of the city will depend on \" the people \\'s participation in public matters . \" in fact , the organization \\'s slogan is \" nothing is fixed alone . participate . \" \" we are looking at a compromised future , \" @entity13 said . \" we do n\\'t talk about that . we do n\\'t have the money to generate work here . \" one bright spot : @entity4 investment is making a comeback . @entity4 companies @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in @entity1 over the last year . that hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago . but with the average salary at $ 20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores , or factories , along the @entity4 - @entity2 border in @entity1 , @entity13 says more needs to be done . the scars from the recent past remain . several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti . americans who , before the violence , came to @entity1 for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence . but in a sign of progress , the @entity19 amended its travel warning for the city . while it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution , it \\'s no longer telling people not to come . longtime residents of @entity1 and neighboring @entity7 may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed . in the last year , however , they have definitely noticed that \" life is back . \" \" i measure it by the everyday coming and going of people , \" @entity20 , 39 , told @entity0 . \" for someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis , it \\'s encouraging to be crossing back to @entity1 without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen . \" @entity20 lived in @entity1 until he was 15 and now lives in @entity7 . he says the threat of violence is \" still a little bit concerning , \" though that has n\\'t stopped him in recent weeks from going to @entity1 to meet friends for dinner and drinks . \" things have changed , \" he said . \" to go through what @entity1 went through , you see life there again . you see a semblance of what was there before . to really recover and heal wounds , there \\'s a long way to go , but the process has started and that \\'s a step in the right direction . \" @entity21 \\'s @entity22 contributed to this report .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) the shootings \\' main similarity is that the officer was white and the victim was black and unarmed . outside of that , the highly publicized police shootings in @entity1 and @entity2 bear only mild resemblance . so what \\'s changed between the shooting death of @entity3 in @entity1 , @entity4 , in august , and that of @entity5 in @entity2 , @entity6 , last weekend ? and did the backlash and publicity of the @entity1 shooting influence the handling of the @entity2 incident ? it \\'s tough to say for sure , but here are some of the stark differences in the cases , the lessons learned by both police and the public , and concrete changes that could help mend tensions in the future . @entity1 : officer @entity7 said he shot @entity3 after the two struggled over @entity7 \\'s gun , and witnesses to the shooting had different accounts -- often conflicting -- of where @entity7 was , where @entity3 was and whether @entity3 was surrendering or charging the officer . @entity2 : though it \\'s unclear what happened in the moments before a bystander began recording the incident on his phone , it \\'s 100 % clear from the video that @entity5 was not posing a threat to officer @entity8 when the policeman opened fire on @entity5 as he ran away . takeaway : where @entity3 \\'s killing was a breeding ground for speculation -- with a stark divide between those who said @entity7 was justified and those who said @entity3 was senselessly slain -- no such debate has emerged in the @entity5 shooting . it would be tough to extrapolate for certain , but it \\'s possible that the clear - cut imagery of an officer shooting a fleeing man in the back resulted in the prompt charges against the officer , and that quick reaction by authorities in @entity6 after the video surfaced headed off the sort of violence that repeatedly unfolded in @entity1 as the process of determining @entity7 \\'s fate dragged on for months . @entity1 : black residents outnumber whites in the @entity9 suburb by more than a 2 - to - 1 ratio , yet at the time of @entity3 \\'s shooting , there were only three black officers on the city \\'s 53 - member force , and there was only one @entity10 - @entity11 member of the six - member @entity12 . ( two more african - americans were voted in during this week \\'s city \\'s elections . ) @entity2 : it \\'s closer to an even split here , with census data from 2010 showing the city is 47 % black and 42 % white . the makeup of the city \\'s police department is unclear , though it \\'s been widely reported that 2007 federal figures indicated it was about 80 % black . three of the 10 city council members are black . takeaway : the ratio of white and black officers on the @entity13 appears to more closely mirror the makeup of its population than does the @entity14 , but both are considerably off . as for the city councils , the latest election in @entity1 makes its governing body more representative than @entity2 \\'s . but before you place too much emphasis on the percentages , there are other variables to consider , like policing methods , as @entity0 political commentator @entity15 pointed out . changing the racial makeup of a department alone wo n\\'t do the trick if officers are n\\'t taught the best practices . \" black people did n\\'t march and fight and struggle to have black officers kill us and black officers beat us and black officers harass us , \" he said . \" i want police officers who are capable of doing the job properly . we need community - based policing if we \\'re going to believe that police are the proper force to be in our neighborhoods . \" @entity1 : there was no bystander video of @entity3 \\'s death -- no concrete evidence to support or refute different witness claims about what had transpired . @entity2 : it \\'s unlikely @entity8 would have been fired and charged with murder so quickly if not for video shot by witness @entity16 . even @entity2 \\'s police chief said he was disgusted by the footage of @entity5 \\'s shooting . not only does the video show @entity8 firing eight shots at @entity5 as he \\'s running away , it also shows him placing a dark - colored object next to @entity5 \\'s lifeless body . that could be significant , because @entity8 initially said @entity5 had taken his taser and he feared for his life . but if investigators determine the object dropped next to @entity5 \\'s body was actually the @entity17 , @entity8 could be accused of planting evidence . the takeaway : @entity1 resident @entity18 said what happened in her city helped people across the country to feel empowered to stand up for themselves . the video of the @entity2 shooting , she said , is vital . \" if there is no video , folks do n\\'t believe it because it sounds so asinine that something like this would ever happen in this country , \" she said . \" but with a video , you ca n\\'t say it \\'s not happening . \" @entity1 : the largely peaceful protests in @entity1 were marred by looting , arson and even shootings . @entity19 erupted again in november after @entity7 , the officer who shot @entity3 , was n\\'t indicted . and even after @entity1 \\'s police chief resigned last month , two officers were shot during a protest at the @entity14 . @entity2 : after @entity5 was killed in @entity6 over the weekend , protests in @entity2 have been peaceful so far . the takeaway : some @entity1 residents say what happened in their city is playing a role in the way @entity2 is handling its own tragedy . @entity20 , who recently made an unsuccessful bid for a @entity21 seat , said he was glad to see authorities in @entity6 charge @entity8 with murder . \" i am hopeful that their motives are right and not just based on the fact that they are trying to avoid the same types of issues that came down in @entity1 , \" @entity20 said . @entity1 : it took @entity1 police six days to publicly identify @entity7 as the officer who shot @entity3 , and in the immediate aftermath of the shooting , then - police chief @entity22 decided not to visit @entity3 \\'s family . and rather than charge @entity7 and let a grand jury decide whether the charges had merit -- as many civil rights advocates wanted -- the prosecutor in the case instead made the unorthodox choice of presenting both sides himself and letting the grand jury decide whether to charge the officer . @entity2 : @entity8 was identified by authorities and charged with murder on tuesday , two days after @entity16 shared his video with @entity5 \\'s family . mayor @entity23 denounced the shooting and said @entity8 made a \" bad decision . \" both @entity23 and the police chief also visited @entity5 \\'s family . \" when you \\'re wrong , you \\'re wrong , \" he said . \" and if you make a bad decision -- do n\\'t care if you \\'re behind the shield or just a citizen on the street -- you have to live by that decision . \" the takeaway : former @entity1 mayor @entity24 said the city has influenced others . \" i think these situations are given much more scrutiny now , \" said @entity24 , who won a seat on @entity1 \\'s city council this week . \" they have seen what has happened here in @entity1 . every mayor and city council is very cautious in what they say and what they do . \" @entity1 : after @entity3 \\'s death in august , many asked why @entity7 did n\\'t have a body camera . the shooting spurred a nationwide debate over whether officers should wear cameras on their lapels . three months later , president @entity25 pledged $ 263 million to procure body cameras and training for up to 50,000 police officers . @entity2 : @entity8 also was not wearing a body camera when he killed @entity5 . but after the shooting , the mayor said the city was ordering an additional 150 body cameras \" so every officer on the street \" in the city will have one . that \\'s in addition to 101 body cameras already ordered , @entity23 said . the takeaway : not everyone agrees that all officers should wear body cameras . some police unions have scoffed at the idea , and the @entity26 has cited privacy concerns . they \\'re also expensive . several camera models cost at least $ 500 each , and storing all that footage can cost as much as $ 20,000 a year . but @entity27 president @entity28 said more body cameras will help protect not just the public , but also police . \" i think if officers know that their actions are being recorded on a consistent basis , it \\'s going to protect good officers who do the right thing , \" @entity28 said . \" but it \\'s also going to ferret out , if you will , bad actions by bad officers . \" @entity0 \\'s @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 contributed to the report .',\n",

he also is still embarrassed when questioners remind audiences how he knifed his brother @entity26 to get the leader \\'s job . the impression so far is that @entity1 \\'s voters do n\\'t much like the conservatives despite the recovering economy but do n\\'t quite trust @entity5 to continue the improvement . @entity4 , told by his handlers to look tough , is using the \" i \" word too much . @entity2 is curiously short on passion . an oddity of the @entity27 debate was that many who viewed it will have no chance of voting for two of the leaders involved , @entity12 of the @entity13 and @entity28 of @entity15 . but @entity12 \\'s high score in the post-debate polls was significant . she was sharp and sassy . the number of seats gained by the @entity29 , currently on target to win as many as 50 of the 59 @entity30 seats in @entity31 , will be crucial . last time @entity5 won 41 of those seats : the more the @entity13 take , the weaker @entity5 \\'s chance of a majority at @entity30 will be . @entity4 says he wo n\\'t form a coalition with the @entity13 but it could be difficult for @entity5 to govern without some deal with their bitter opponents north of the border . if there was a \" winner \" in the debate it was @entity12 . back in the 2010 @entity1 election debates the clear victor was @entity6 of the @entity7 . then the two main party leaders frequently found themselves parroting \" i agree with @entity6 . \" by entering a coalition government with @entity2 ( in which the @entity7 \\' insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery ) , @entity6 surrendered the @entity7 \\' previous ability to pick up protest votes . @entity6 and his party have paid a heavy price for the compromises made in government , notably on student tuition fees . his debate performance was as good as any of the seven leaders but no poll gave him a rating of better than 10 % . perception is everything . in social media and studio focus groups there were plenty of plaudits for the @entity32 and even for @entity15 \\'s @entity28 but @entity6 got hardly a mention . the @entity9 remains the joker in the pack . the party once dismissed by @entity2 as a collection of \" fruitcakes , loonies and closet racists \" is a serious threat to the @entity3 -- and @entity5 -- despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately . but @entity9 , more than any of the others , is a personal vehicle for its leader and the debate was crucial for them . grinning @entity8 \\'s blokey saloon bar manner goes down well with studio audiences and he kept the focus on immigration . his party wo n\\'t win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests , sometimes taking votes off the @entity3 , sometimes off @entity5 . @entity8 has always traded on the outer edge of political civilities and by insisting in the debate that immigrants were responsible for 60 % of @entity33 cases he earned condemnation from other leaders . on social media , dominated by the young , that earned him the maximum boo count . to \" win \" a tv election debate you need to avoid gaffes yourself , to wrongfoot your opponent , and to offer some excitement that gives your campaign the chance to develop momentum . you need to produce vivid soundbites which will work their way into summary reports of the debates and into campaign replays . nobody has yet succeeded in doing that in this campaign . the highly paid spin doctors employed by the three major parties are simply not worth their money . the emphasis has been on sound defense : nobody has yet scored an exciting goal . as the campaign moves on , chances will have to be taken . read : @entity34 , bacon and beer : the real issues in @entity1 \\'s election',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) last month @entity1 was taken into custody for planning to protest on @entity2 against sexual harassment in @entity3 . since then , the @entity3 authorities have formally detained her and four other activists for \" creating disturbances . \" they also briefly detained some of the activists \\' supporters , raided a prominent nongovernmental organization that called for their release , and have at points denied some of the women access to medical treatment , lawyers and adequate rest . the fate of the five will be revealed by april 13 , as their case reaches the legal time limit when they must either be released or \" formally arrested , \" which almost always leads to conviction in @entity3 \\'s legal system . the timing of the detentions of @entity3 \\'s most inventive women \\'s rights activists is ironic : not only did they take place on the very day that marks women \\'s achievements and their struggle for equality , but they also come in a year in which @entity4 would have won praise for its role in promoting women \\'s rights . it appears poised to adopt its first and long - awaited anti-domestic violence law , which is expected to get a reading before the @entity5 this summer . this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential @entity6 hosted in @entity4 , during which @entity7 famously declared that \" women \\'s rights are human rights . \" i first met @entity1 at a conference several years ago , at a time when there were very few women in @entity3 \\'s weiquan or \" rights defense \" movement . it was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them as \" babes \" or \" little sisters , \" even in professional — and ostensibly progressive — settings . as women \\'s rights activists , @entity1 and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the @entity3 government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second - class citizens . by the time we met again two years later , @entity1 and her young \" direct - action \" feminist colleagues were clearly off and running . they staged small , public \" performance art \" protests that attracted media headlines , energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women \\'s rights movement , and pushed women \\'s rights into the national consciousness and onto the government \\'s agenda . @entity1 had an upbringing typical of her times . she comes from the countryside , which for many has changed beyond recognition within their lifetimes . in recent decades the economy has soared , but her generation is confronting the unhappy consequences of unchecked growth : pollution , unsafe foods and growing inequality between rich and poor . like many parents , she worries about how to find untainted milk powder for her infant boy , and whether to keep her child with her in the city or to send him to his grandparents in the countryside for a quieter , safer upbringing . many in @entity8 and her colleagues \\' generation are clear - eyed about the problems of @entity3 \\'s development model , and some want to address those . @entity1 joined @entity9 , a nonprofit organization that promotes social equality , whether it is between sexes or among people with and without disabilities , and later founded the women \\'s rights organization @entity10 . and it is in @entity11 that she became particularly attuned to the challenges confronting young women in modern @entity3 . @entity1 and her colleagues have used innovative tactics with a certain shock factor — \" occupying \" public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women , donning blood - spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence , shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women — that raises awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate , especially with young women in the country . perhaps this is what the government finds threatening : that these activists epitomize the spirit of the times . they are young , confident , ready to challenge established norms , and most importantly , they feel responsible for their society and they want to improve it . as @entity3 prepares to mark the anniversary of the @entity6 in september , it will be harder for the authorities to justify detaining these activists . but even if they are released , their work promoting women \\'s rights will have become exponentially more difficult . the women will now be labeled \" sensitive \" individuals at a time when the authorities are increasingly paranoid about independent groups , their role in fostering nonviolent protests and the overthrow of oppressive governments ( known as \" color revolutions \" ) , and foreign funding of civil society organizations . what @entity1 and her colleagues are now enduring is consistent with a broader government effort to strangle independent activism . authorities have harassed and detained an ever expanding list of activists , and imprisoned others , but they have also tried to co-opt some groups by allowing them to provide services the government finds acceptable , so long as they abandon their activism . this kind of \" differentiated management \" of nongovernmental organizations — punishing some but co-opting others — may work to neutralize some of the more outspoken groups . but ultimately the desires for change among ordinary people that make @entity1 and her friends \\' campaigns so popular are unlikely to be answered through \" authoritarian activism \" alone . the @entity12 now faces a dizzying array of challenges , not least that younger generations do not identify with the party or its values like past generations . rather than lengthening its list of challenges , the party could resolve some and lessen concerns about its legitimacy by freeing and engaging activists like @entity1 and her colleagues , rather than treating them as criminals .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) on thursday , @entity1 -- headquartered in @entity2 , just 40 miles away from @entity3 -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25 - year - old @entity4 because of still - unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody . unfortunately , while it was a freshly produced segment , it was hardly a new story . titled \" @entity5 , \" the five - minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \" what \\'s really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city , \" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was african - americans \" targeting @entity6 - owned businesses for destruction . \" a similar claim was made after @entity7 \\'s uprising in august of last year . indeed , it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s , the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between @entity6 and black communities first took root in the media consciousness . yes , interethnic tensions continue to exist , though they are hardly limited to @entity8 and blacks . and yes , this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides . but while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year , black - owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence , there \\'s little evidence to suggest a pattern in which @entity6 businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus . instead , it seems as if @entity6 - owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods . in other words , they were collateral damage , along with other stores in the vicinity of riots . so it \\'s time to call this persistent meme what it is : a misleading , hyperbolic and dangerous distraction , one that shifts blame away from the real issues . as @entity9 , sociology professor at @entity10 , and author of the 2002 book \" @entity11 : blacks , jews and @entity12 in @entity13 , \" notes , \" the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor , disadvantaged communities . by directing our attention to interminority conflict , it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems . \" let \\'s be honest . there were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely @entity14 customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences . there \\'s no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures . for example , in 1993 , the robbery and shooting of @entity15 , a 21 - year - old @entity16 at @entity17 , and the subsequent acquittal of his killer , was a point of contention between the @entity16 and @entity14 communities . but things are different now . decades after the height of media - inflamed tension between @entity6 and @entity14 , patterns of immigration have shifted . stores once operated by recent @entity16 immigrants are now owned by strivers from @entity18 , the @entity19 and @entity20 . the population of @entity3 has shrunk and its economy has contracted . among merchants , there \\'s ever - greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread , surviving or failing together . for decades , black and @entity6 advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities . for example , the @entity3 - based @entity21 of @entity22 , founded in 1995 , has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by @entity3 \\'s police , while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents . a kagro - sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the @entity3 neighborhoods their member retailers serve . these are n\\'t the kind of stories you \\'ll hear in the media . it \\'s easier to focus on attention - grabbing anecdotes rather than the long , hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities . back in 1995 , the @entity23 profiled soon @entity24 and @entity25 , owners of @entity15 \\'s @entity26 in the @entity27 @entity3 \\'s @entity28 neighborhood -- the same part of the city that @entity1 called out as a locus of @entity6 - black tension . the story highlighted the @entity29 \\' openness to the community , their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity , which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year . i spoke with @entity25 , calling her without warning to check on the status of the @entity30 \\' four -

       "  '( @entity0 ) well , the thought experiments are finally over . @entity1 \\'s online declaration for president means the focus will now shift to the campaign and to what kind of president she might be . and nowhere will the speculation be greater than in the area of foreign policy , certain to be a major issue in the upcoming campaign . should she win , @entity2 will add to her potential \" firsts \" : first woman president ; the first president who had been a first lady . there \\'s another one , too : the first secretary of state to become president since @entity3 . only a handful of the nation \\'s top diplomats have gone to the @entity4 ( @entity5 ; @entity6 ; @entity7 ; @entity8 ; @entity9 @entity10 ; and @entity3 ) . and none in the 20th century , a curious fact that suggests politics and statecraft are quite different animals . too few of our secretaries of state have had the necessary experience of elected office or the desire , ambition and temperament to compete for the top job . still , on balance , @entity2 \\'s tenure at the @entity11 should be a real advantage during the campaign , particularly when compared with the absence of foreign policy experience among her prospective @entity12 rivals . but this will be no cake walk for her on the foreign policy side . @entity2 will have to negotiate and traverse several tricky and rocky paths to ensure that her @entity11 career remains an advantage and does n\\'t turn into a liability . here \\'s why : the last president to serve in a top job in the administration of his immediate predecessor was @entity13 . circumstances were different then . far from wanting to distance himself from @entity14 , @entity13 41 saw merit in reinforcing the association with a president who dominated his day in a way few chief executives have . @entity2 will face a harder balancing act : how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in @entity15 \\'s first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak , vacillating and fairly or not , responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse , especially in the @entity16 and with @entity17 , than when president @entity15 took office . in the process , she \\'ll have to define her own approach to the world . indeed , given the president \\'s vulnerabilities on foreign policy , she ca n\\'t afford to be seen as @entity15 \\'s third term . in her memoir \" @entity18 , \" she \\'s already laid the foundation for distancing herself from @entity15 on issues such as doing more for the @entity19 opposition and being tougher on @entity17 \\'s @entity20 . and she can legitimately work to sharpen those differences without seeming to walk away from policies she supported and leaving herself open to charges that she has no principles , only politically expedient tactics . too much loyalty to a president who is unpopular among independents will hurt her . but so will flip - flopping . nowhere will her challenges be greater than on @entity21 . @entity2 presided over the secret channel that laid the basis for the november 2013 interim accord and led directly to the putative understandings reached between the @entity22 and @entity21 earlier this month in @entity23 , @entity24 . and she certainly can take credit for pushing tough sanctions that forced @entity21 to the table . the problem , of course , is that her @entity12 opponents and more than a few @entity25 hate what the negotiations have produced . much less enamored with the @entity15 \\'s \" let \\'s engage our enemies \" trope , @entity2 may have doubts herself . the good news is that there wo n\\'t be an agreement for months . so for now , she can back the importance of tough negotiating and even tougher sanctions or worse , should the @entity21 cheat . but sooner or later , perhaps as early as june if there \\'s an agreement , @entity2 will have to take a stand on what may well be a very problematic and unpopular accord and what @entity26 \\' role should be . her opponents , the @entity27 , and much of the organized @entity28 community , will portray it as even worse , and that is likely to be somewhat problematic and will be hyped as even worse . and this will put her at odds with traditional friends and supporters in the @entity28 community . frankly given her political interests , it would be easier for her candidacy if the agreement fell apart and she could campaign on a tough @entity29 message , hammering the mullahs \\' repressive policies at home and their mischief - making in the region . she may not be that lucky . still she will have an advantage in dealing with the @entity30 community . unlike president @entity15 , the @entity31 have strong credentials on the @entity27 issue . and that will help somewhat in trying to walk a narrow line between a negotiating process with @entity21 that @entity2 launched and its fruits , which are seen by many @entity27 and @entity22 @entity28 right now as too generous to the mullahs . @entity2 \\'s time at the @entity11 should help her in a presidential campaign where @entity22 are looking for strong and prudent leadership in foreign policy and more adult supervision in the @entity4 . the @entity12 will try and show that @entity32 and the email controversy have tarnished her image as secretary and claim she did n\\'t accomplish much . @entity2 was n\\'t a @entity33 or a @entity34 . but given the problems she confronted -- @entity21 , stalled @entity27 - @entity35 two - state negotiations ( none ready for any kind of solution or breakthrough ) and a president who dominated rather than delegated foreign policy , she performed ably enough . she improved the nation \\'s image and pushed 21st century issues such as women \\'s rights , youth , and the environment . her critics will dismiss all this as a kind of naive planetary humanism . still , four years as secretary of state will help her project the kind of confidence and competence that will appear to many as an important credential to lead @entity22 in a dangerous and turbulent world . and in a presidential campaign where none of her opponents has her long experience in international affairs , that can only help . @entity2 \\'s biggest challenge on the campaign trail and in office should she win is whether she can develop a foreign policy vision and an effective approach to the world that strikes a better balance between the risk - readiness of @entity36 and the risk - aversion of @entity15 . and given the cruel and unforgiving nature of the world @entity22 now inhabits , this will be no easy task .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) over the last few years , we \\'ve been close to eradicating worldwide polio without full success . however , a new medical technology , an easily applied microneedle patch , could be the key to that goal . the biggest challenge standing in the way of eradicating polio has involved the operational logistics of getting the vaccine to people who need it , especially in difficult areas plagued by violence or poverty . the microneedle patch , which resembles a small , round adhesive bandage , could bring polio vaccines to the doorsteps of the people that need it . by applying it to the skin and pushing down , the vaccine is delivered in a matter of minutes . rather than requiring highly trained medics , minimally trained personnel could go from door to door , quickly administering the vaccine . it \\'s been 60 years since a mass inoculation of @entity1 \\'s vaccine began with school children in april , 1955 that caused polio cases in the @entity2 to drop by almost 90 % over the course of two years . the vaccine was eagerly awaited because , according to the @entity3 , about 35,000 people annually became disabled because of polio in the @entity2 in the 1940s and \\' 50s . in 1938 , @entity4 founded the @entity5 , an organization known today as the @entity5 , to fight polio . the organization funded the two vaccines -- one created by @entity1 and another by @entity6 -- that would lead to the protection of most of the world against polio . @entity1 \\'s vaccine , developed in the 1950s , involved injecting a virus that was \" killed , \" while @entity6 \\'s vaccine -- which he worked on in the 1960s and which was administered orally -- contained a weakened version of polio . the @entity6 vaccine actually helped boost immunity in communities beyond the individual because people shed the weakened virus in their feces . it came to replace the @entity1 in many places between 1963 and 1999 , according to the @entity7 . but the injected \" killed \" virus version is what \\'s given in the @entity2 today because of the rare instances of people developing polio from the oral vaccine . most people with polio have no symptoms ;

       "  '( @entity0 ) the justices of the @entity1 practice politics as much as law -- and that will be clearer than ever when the issue of same - sex marriage comes before the court on tuesday . public opinion on same - sex marriage has turned upside down since the @entity2 in @entity3 first legalized the practice in 2003 . overwhelming opposition has turned into substantial majority support , especially among young people of all political persuasions . even the name of the issue has changed -- to marriage equality . of course , the @entity4 has not changed since 2003 , a point that will surely be made by such opponents of same - sex marriage as justice @entity5 . to originalists like @entity5 -- those who believe the @entity4 should be interpreted only as it was originally understood by the framers -- the idea of a constitutional right to same - sex marriage is anathema . to them , the @entity4 means only what it meant to those who wrote it -- and @entity6 ( or the authors of the 14th amendment , just after the @entity7 ) never gave a thought to whether they were granting gay people the right to marry . but the @entity1 has always been about a lot more than the intentions of the framers . and public opinion is just one of the extrajudicial factors that the justices sometimes take into consideration . in 1954 , the @entity1 ruled unanimously that public schools could no longer segregate students by race , even though the authors of the 14th amendment clearly considered segregated schools to be permissible . chief justice @entity8 , who wrote the opinion in @entity9 , recognized that the world had changed , especially in light of the @entity10 . @entity8 knew that segregated schools damaged the @entity11 \\' reputation in the contest for hearts and minds around the world , and he steered the court accordingly . @entity8 \\'s motives had nothing to do with the framers \\' intentions , and little to do with the words of the @entity4 itself , but these kinds of motivations have been common throughout the history of the @entity1 . there are risks , of course , when the justices are guided by more than the text and history of the @entity4 . like everyone else , the justices have imperfect instincts when it comes to measuring public attitudes . justice @entity12 is a fervent supporter of abortion rights for women , but she has expressed reservations about the court \\'s decision in @entity13 , the 1973 ruling that required all 50 states to legalize abortion . she has argued that the court interrupted a political process for legalization that was already underway , and that the case ignited a backlash that wound up hurting the cause of abortion rights . her position is debatable on several scores . abortion rights were not ascendant everywhere in the \\' 70s , and opponents were already well mobilized . but @entity12 \\'s misgivings about @entity13 have served as an important backdrop to the @entity1 \\'s consideration of same - sex marriage . still , when it comes to @entity1 decisions , it is usually safe to bet that a majority of the justices will come down on the side favored by most of the public . in any case , as we head into the argument , it looks like most of the justices have already made up their minds . after the court decided @entity14 in 2013 , which invalidated most of the 1996 law known as the @entity15 , more than a dozen federal district courts around the county said the reasoning of that case required the legalization of same - sex marriage . these judges allowed these marriages to begin taking place around the country . supporters of the existing laws went to the @entity1 and asked for stays of the lower court rulings , because the justices themselves had not yet permitted the marriages to take place . but in each case , the @entity1 denied the stays and allowed same - sex marriages to proceed -- those marriages are now legal in 37 states and the @entity16 . in a brief dissenting opinion from the failure to grant the stays , justice @entity17 suggested the issue had already been settled in the minds of his colleagues . \" this acquiescence [ in allowing marriages to proceed ] may well be seen as a signal of the court \\'s intended resolution of that question , \" @entity17 wrote . \" this is not the proper way to discharge our ... responsibilities . \" but @entity17 only drew @entity5 to join his dissent , suggesting that even fellow conservatives chief justice @entity18 and @entity19 saw the writing on the wall . in any case , at oral argument , we \\'ll get a clue what the justices are thinking about the issue . but we already know that their decision , like so many in the court \\'s history , will be based on a great deal more than the text of the @entity4 .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) so now the real trial is underway : what does the surviving @entity1 bomber , @entity2 , deserve and why ? what \\'s he likely to get and why ? let \\'s start where the penalty phase starts , with the prosecution \\'s case . prosecutors have listed , as they must , the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment . the killing was \" heinous , cruel and depraved . \" he placed a bomb in a crowd , set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that \\'s not heinous , cruel and depraved , what is ? cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims , or , at the opposite extreme , it reflects a cold , callous indifference . @entity2 displayed both . cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst . the number of dead from the bombing ( three ) and injured ( 260 ) , including dozens maimed , also elevate these murders . the victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8 - year - old @entity3 . for 2,500 years , we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable , yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy , and those who prey on them as especially culpable . the prosecution \\'s emphasis : the killings involved \" substantial planning and premeditation \" and a betrayal of the @entity4 -- the very country that gave @entity2 shelter and citizenship . and then there \\'s the selection of the site , the @entity1 , an \" iconic \" event . and then there \\'s @entity5 \\'s lack of remorse -- opening day , the prosecutor \\'s final shot of @entity2 locked up , giving the security camera the finger . from his blood - scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day , the message has been : screw you , society . @entity2 may take the stand to beg for mercy , but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse . and do n\\'t confuse regret with remorse . no doubt @entity2 regrets his present predicament , regrets the negative publicity he \\'s brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape . but that \\'s a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he \\'s killed and maimed . @entity2 was the lesser of two evils , the defense will insist over and over . @entity6 was the source of his younger brother \\'s malicious intent . as the prisoners inside @entity7 \\'s now defunct @entity8 once described the street code to me : no snitching , but if someone dies , then \" the dead guy did everything . \" so the defense will claim that @entity2 was not fully responsible because he could not be . after all , he was only 19 . biologists teach us our brains do n\\'t fully develop until we \\'re 25 . thus , their argument goes , a 19 - year - old simply ca n\\'t be the worst of the worst . in 2005 , the @entity4 @entity9 struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed , repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists @entity10 and @entity11 . but in the same article , these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an \" open question whether under real - world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults . \" and they were talking about 17 - year - olds . to the best of my knowledge , science has not and can not establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility . think about it : when a 19 - year - old bravely dashes into a burning building , risking his life to save children inside , we celebrate this heroism . we do not , nor should we , dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not - yet - fully - formed personality . if we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults , why ca n\\'t we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst ? what outcome would i predict in the @entity2 case ? confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones , hearing offsetting pleas to \" move on , \" balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the imagined punishment of life that awaits @entity2 , i expect the jury will vote 10 - 2 ( or 9 - 3 ) for death . but they must be unanimous for death ; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence . worse , the historical record and headlines in the next day \\'s anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim : \" @entity12 for the @entity13 \" -- even if overwhelmingly the people \\'s representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment . requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many . why ? because in the end , we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people . and yet , if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime , if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals , surely the @entity1 bomber stands among the worst of the worst .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) since the headline - grabbing murder of @entity1 journalist @entity2 by @entity3 militants eight months ago , the world has been regularly confronted with a modern form of an ancient , primally horrifying method of execution . @entity4 and @entity1 aid workers , @entity5 and @entity1 journalists , @entity6 and @entity7 soldiers and @entity8 and now @entity9 @entity10 were among those who followed in @entity2 \\'s wake : their gruesome beheadings documented on camera and disseminated as propaganda to a global online audience . these highly ritualized killings have galvanized international opposition to the group -- and helped attract a wave of foreign recruits to the @entity3 cause . but beyond this , some experts such as psychology professor @entity11 suggest , the wave of savage beheadings may be having an unlikely knock - on effect . he says the spate of jihadist beheadings may be encouraging copy - cat acts or threats of decapitation -- not only from @entity12 , but from the \" disbelievers \" they target . @entity11 , distinguished professor of psychology at the @entity13 , says the frequent , high profile reports of @entity3 beheadings could result in psychologically \" priming \" people to be more inclined to emulate them , or threaten to , during moments of conflict or extreme stress . because of the attention that jihadist beheadings have commanded internationally , \" the very concept of beheading , that was virtually non-existent in our unconscious prior to these events being propagated , is now there , \" he told @entity0 . \" it comes to mind when a conflict happens , when you react aggressively , \" he said . \" it sits there in our unconscious and can be activated under certain circumstances when the passions run high , and result in actual behavior . \" reports of beheadings also emerge from @entity14 , where it is a legal method of execution under the country \\'s judicial code ; and @entity15 and @entity16 , where it is typically the work of criminal gangs . but neither has placed the practice in the global spotlight to anything like the same degree as @entity3 \\'s propaganda , in which the threat is extended to \" disbelievers \" around the globe . a similar copy - cat effect had been observed with the phenomenon of school mass shootings , said @entity11 . \" once the idea is planted then when someone is upset , feeling violent , the idea of getting a gun and shooting up a school comes more readily to mind , because it \\'s sitting there in our unconscious , \" he said . a lack of hard data on the global incidence of beheadings makes it impossible to say conclusively whether such killings are being carried out by non-jihadists more often . but reports of such cases have been frequently making the headlines . in december and january , two victims were decapitated -- outside a @entity17 home , and in a shopping mall in @entity18 \\'s @entity19 province -- in crimes with no apparent connection to terror . in @entity20 alone , a city deeply impacted by the murder and attempted decapitation of soldier @entity21 by @entity12 extremists in 2013 , three women were reportedly beheaded last year in alleged crimes with no apparent jihadist motivation . and in the @entity1 , an @entity22 man is awaiting trial , accused of beheading a co-worker in september . ( whether he was inspired by @entity3 propaganda remains unclear ; he was reportedly a recent convert to @entity12 and had posted @entity23 and beheading content online . ) whether or not \" non-jihadist \" beheadings are on the increase , this brutal method of killing has inarguably come to occupy a larger part of the public consciousness , as @entity3 \\'s beheadings have grabbed international headlines and the terror group \\'s call on supporters to attack \" disbelievers \" has reverberated worldwide . in @entity24 and the @entity25 , jihad - related threats or plots to decapitate have allegedly been made in the past seven months ; recently , a @entity26 convert in @entity20 was found guilty of a plot to behead a @entity4 soldier , inspired by the @entity21 murder . the theme of beheading was also front and center in an incident in @entity27 in january , where fans of football team @entity28 unfurled a giant banner depicting the severed head of an opponent . the club condemned their actions as \" totally unacceptable . \" beyond this , threats to behead also seem to have gained a wider currency among non-jihadists , said @entity11 . in the @entity1 , a @entity29 man was arrested in january for threatening to decapitate the @entity30 police officer who put @entity31 in a fatal choke hold , which triggered widespread civil rights protests . and months earlier , in october , police reportedly received a threat to behead elementary school students in @entity32 . @entity33 , a professor of crime , policing , security and justice at the @entity34 said the @entity3 beheadings may have shown those engaging in attention - seeking threats of violence a sure way to get noticed . \" an awareness of what really shocks and gets \\' news \\' is clearly on show , \" he said . the threats and banner demonstrated the way in which the spread of beheading rhetoric may be having a psychologically \" brutalizing \" effect on society , said @entity11 , intensifying the violence of our thoughts , words and actions . \" ultimately , we \\'re talking about contributing to the brutalization of interpersonal and inter-group conflict all over the planet , \" he said . @entity35 , a senior lecturer in international relations and comparative politics at the @entity36 , said that while @entity3 beheadings \" might inspire some people to prefer that particular way to kill people as opposed to others , \" he believed it would eventually fall out of favor . while beheading had been adopted by @entity3 as their stock in trade , it would inevitably lose its shock value , driving jihadists to ramp up the levels of atrocity in order to continue capturing international attention . one such dramatic escalation occurred in february , when @entity3 released a propaganda video in which the tactic of beheading was abandoned altogether for fresh horrors -- burning @entity37 pilot @entity38 alive in a cage . later that month , @entity3 released a video released showing what appeared to be @entity6 @entity39 fighters paraded down @entity40 streets in cages . for many , a baffling aspect to the executions has been how such overweening brutality could win support for the @entity3 cause . while the executions are viewed by the vast majority of people as repellent , @entity11 said , they could exert a strong pull for sympathizers by projecting \" a sense of godlike power . \" \" we all have this morbid , instinctual fascination with death and killing and torture , which is sublimated and constrained by civilization and our culture and socialization , \" he said . \" most of us are peaceful even though these drives exist in our subconscious ; civilization rests on its ability to constrain them . \" but when the \" death instinct \" -- \" this drive to kill and promote violence \" -- was legitimized by a powerful narrative , such as a religious or ideological call to global jihad , \" then that can result in unregulated atrocities , \" he said . for some foreign jihadists who had traveled to @entity40 and @entity7 to fight for @entity3 , the realities of the so - called \" @entity41 \" had driven them to return home disenchanted , he said . but others remained . \" in each of us there is this battle of good versus evil , \" said @entity11 . \" it \\'s a battle in everybody \\'s soul . \"',\n",

@entity3 : our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible . in order to come into the home , you need to have lost both parents , or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect , abuse or have a parent who \\'s incarcerated . we have to conduct a full investigation . so usually that involves going to the child \\'s village , making calls , doing police checks , getting documentation and paperwork . we have to dig up birth certificates , death certificates , make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does . @entity2 : meanwhile , you have 350 children attending your school . what is their background ? @entity3 : every single year we \\'ll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants . and we choose the ones who are the most needful and really wo n\\'t be in school without us . most of them live in one room , a mud hut . a lot of them are just in survival mode . we try to relieve the burden from the family , so that the child has food , medical care , books , zero fees for education . @entity2 : what have you learned working with the local community in @entity1 ?

@entity3 : we started with the home and then school . we run the school lunch program . then we needed to keep our kids really healthy , so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center . from there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food . and then from there we decided to start a women \\'s center . we just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off - the - grid campus . this year we converted to solar energy . so we \\'ll have a high school and then a day care , preschool , elementary , all the way up , and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward . it \\'s become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream . it \\'s become a community . and i want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like . want to get involved ?

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 is in the headlines again . according to a @entity2 report thursday , @entity3 nuclear experts have told the @entity4 that @entity5 may already have as many as 20 nuclear warheads . and while that number may seem stunning , it is actually only part of a troubling story . the key takeaway from the latest assessment of @entity1 \\'s nuclear capability is not in the actual number of warheads , but the type of warhead , as this gives a better clue to the future of the country \\'s weapons capabilities . true , the reported @entity3 estimate of 20 warheads is large enough to constitute a nuclear \" arsenal . \" however , this number is not actually significantly larger than conventional open source estimates of 10 to 15 warheads previously provided by @entity4 and other experts . the big takeaway from the report is instead the prediction that @entity1 could be in a position to double its arsenal by next year with weapons - grade uranium . if that assessment is correct , and @entity5 can indeed boost its nuclear stockpile by the end of this year to around 40 warheads by utilizing highly - enriched weapons - grade uranium , then the plutonium program that the @entity4 and members of the @entity6 talks had been negotiating over this past quarter century would suddenly seem trivial . after all , the plutonium program might be capable of spitting out maybe a few weapons worth of plutonium annually . this news could be much more serious . why ? for a start , it would mean that @entity1 \\'s activities would undoubtedly meet the definition , if it had not already , of a runaway nuclear weapons program , with the potential to be fueled by a large supply of raw uranium buried in @entity1 \\'s mines . in addition , while the plutonium program at @entity7 has a clear and detectable profile , the thousands of centrifuges that spin in a uranium - based program have no detectable heat signature or topographic profile , meaning you could store the stuff not just in the labyrinth of underground tunnels in @entity1 , undetectable from the sky , but in any large warehouse . @entity8 and @entity9 have tended to have a policy that leans toward downplaying @entity1 threats , at least when there is n\\'t a full - fledged crisis going on . for example , the @entity4 downplayed @entity1 \\'s missile threat until the country successfully put a satellite into orbit in december 2012 . and up until 2006 , no one thought the @entity10 regime would actually dare undertake a nuclear test . these new estimates could therefore be a timely reminder that we may have downplayed the threat @entity1 poses once again . but thursday \\'s report is n\\'t the only troubling information we have had recently . just as concerning is the @entity11 commander \\'s assessment on @entity1 \\'s missile capabilities . on april 7 , adm. @entity12 said during a press briefing that the @entity13 believed @entity5 \\'s @entity14 intercontinental ballistic missile ( @entity15 ) is operational , with a warhead capacity . this statement is troubling for two reasons . first , @entity12 \\'s statement , when combined with the latest @entity3 assessment , implies that @entity1 now not only has nuclear weapons , but the ability to miniaturize such weapons for a warhead that could be placed atop a missile with range rings extending to the @entity4 mainland . second , and just as importantly , @entity5 \\'s advances in mobile icbm capabilities could end up undermining the state of stable deterrence that currently exists on the @entity16 . put simply , these capabilities could give @entity1 confidence that it is immune from any @entity4 counterstrikes . and if that ends up being the case , the @entity4 could find itself with a renewed headache in @entity17 -- and its carefully calibrated plans for its pivot to the region crumbling .',\n",

for the most part , yes . but having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest . in this case , mr. @entity1 took off running . the @entity7 and @entity8 courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed . when you add to the suspect \\'s flight the @entity7 \\'s recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion , it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop , constitutionally . much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys , as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual ( 1 ) running away , ( 2 ) in a \" high crime \" area , the stop will usually be \" good . \" but police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk . police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \" armed and presently dangerous \" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons . the charging document does n\\'t really identify a safety concern ... or does it ? after the chase , and before an arrest : \" this officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket . \" should n\\'t that really say : \" i saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where i could n\\'t see it \" ? that \\'s a close call : police were lawfully at the stop stage , but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip ? see how artfully that was done ? observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern . observation of a clip ? i suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips , chip clips , etc. according to @entity9 , an attorney for @entity1 \\'s family , he was carrying a \" pocket knife of legal size , \" and the lawyer contended that police did n\\'t see the knife before the altercation . the legality of the knife will be an issue , but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop . the important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest . in theory , if a stop gives rise to no suspicion , and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint , the citizen should be free to leave . an arrest requires much more : probable cause to believe a crime has been committed , and nothing less . that knife was the only crime he was charged with , so again , police are locked into a narrative by their own report . if it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife , there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest . for example , if the \" knife \" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2 - inch nail clipper , that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest . remember also that based on the police narrative in the report , they did not see the knife until after they seized mr. @entity1 . so the question arises : what would they have done with @entity1 if he had no knife or other contraband on him ? they could , but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in @entity1 \\'s death . as we \\'ve seen , charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult . if you \\'re pro-cop , you could say that \\'s because they are well - trained and rarely abuse their force . if you have a more jaded view of law enforcement , you would say it \\'s because they are well - trained , and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force . @entity2 @entity10 are suggesting mr. @entity1 \\'s injuries occurred after his arrest , while he was being transported back for processing , and that he may not have received proper medical attention . that \\'s not a surprise . in fact , from a liability perspective , this is a good strategic move for the police . it will be harder to hold them liable if @entity1 \\'s injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest . @entity11 , @entity1 \\'s \" seizure \" would be judged by a \" reasonableness \" standard , under the @entity12 . however , courts have limited these \" seizures \" to the initial act of seizing the person . any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the @entity12 . the claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision : the @entity13 of the @entity14 . so what ? what \\'s the difference between the @entity15 and 14th amendment anyway ? when it comes to potential civil liability of the officers , it makes a huge difference . the applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs . under the @entity12 , the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances . under the 14th amendment standard , the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering . that \\'s a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet . fortunately , courts have held that pretrial detainees like @entity1 are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th amendment as are convicted prisoners under the @entity16 , and its prohibition against \" cruel and unusual punishments , \" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners . confused ? you \\'re not alone . even a @entity7 justice has taken issue with this view of the @entity17 . other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the @entity12 after arrest , so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts , judges , and states differ , too . it \\'s just that @entity8 is not within one of those jurisdictions . but it \\'s true . it \\'s a kind of unintentional \" gap \" in constitutional coverage , one the courts have struggled to deal with . based on the law , it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a \" rough ride , \" police might avoid liability in @entity8 if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically . that \\'s a higher standard for liability than if @entity1 was hurt pre-arrest , so , if it \\'s the truth , it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one .',\n",

out left commuters trapped deep beneath the rushing waters of the @entity4 . more than 24 hours later , @entity1 officials were still at pains to explain the power outage . the energy minister suggested a possible failure in transmission lines . the prime minister did not rule out the possibility of a terror attack . the mysterious collapse of much of the country \\'s energy grid triggered a burst of wild conspiracy theories across social media . some @entity5 users went so far as to suggest the black - outs were a warm up for elections scheduled to take place in june . there is fertile ground for rumor - mongering in @entity1 . over the last five years , security forces have arrested hundreds of army generals , journalists , prosecutors , civil society activists and police commanders and accused them of being members of assorted plots aimed at toppling the government . the government \\'s increasingly heavy - handed repression of public dissent , combined with overt censorship of the media and the internet , have also contributed to a hyper - polarized and deeply mistrustful political atmosphere . even @entity1 \\'s veteran deputy prime minister , @entity6 , recently observed that opposition supporters now look at him \" with hatred \" rather than the grudging respect he enjoyed when his political party first swept to power in elections in 2002 . meanwhile , mysterious black - outs are a sore spot for some @entity1 , after a surreal 2014 incident on election night -- allegedly involving a feline saboteur . that is -- a cat that allegedly wandered into a power transformer . that was almost exactly a year ago , a smaller series of power outages affected some polling stations during nationwide municipal elections , prompting unsubstantiated accusations of vote rigging . the ruling @entity7 ended up winning by a comfortable margin , but few @entity1 were reassured by the energy minister \\'s explanation that the voting day black - outs were caused by a cat getting lost . as electricity was just starting to come back on in @entity0 on tuesday , a second crisis erupted . websites linked to an extremist leftist militant group known as the @entity8 began publishing chilling photos of a masked man holding a pistol to the head of a hostage in front of communist flags . two gunmen had somehow infiltrated the @entity9 , the monolithic court house in the center of @entity0 . there they took hostage @entity10 , the prosecutor in charge of one of the most politically sensitive trials in the country . the gunmen demanded the confessions of police officers accused of shooting a tear gas canister at @entity11 , a 15 - year - old boy who was critically wounded during anti-government protests that raged across @entity0 in 2013 . the boy \\'s death after months in a medically - induced coma triggered a fresh burst of protests and riots against the government . on tuesday , in the midst of the hostage crisis at the court house , the @entity1 government imposed a gag order banning broadcasters from reporting on the @entity9 . the broadcast ban is a measure that the @entity1 government has repeatedly used in recent years to stifle reporting on deadly terrorist attacks . the government also famously shut down @entity5 and @entity12 in an effort to kill highly embarrassing political scandals involving corruption . ultimately , tuesday \\'s court house siege ended in a deadly hail of bullets that left both gunmen dead and the prosecutor mortally wounded . @entity1 officials say special forces raided the court house only after the militants began shooting . online and in the streets , some @entity1 began linking the massive electricity blackouts to the hostage - taking inside one of @entity1 \\'s best - protected buildings , even though there is little to suggest the two incidents are connected . just hours after the shooting , tensions exploded yet again at the court house . @entity0 \\'s police chief had called for a press conference . as journalists jostled their way through security at the entrance to the largely deserted courthouse , some bystanders began chanting \" government thieves . \" just hours after a devastating lapse of security at the @entity9 , police began detaining the demonstrators hurling abuse at their elected government . the reactions to tuesday \\'s bewildering series of events revealed several truths about contemporary @entity1 . the country is tense and confused after years of back - to - back political crises . heavy - handed censorship has left the mainstream media widely distrusted and discredited by broad segments of society . and the absence of a common , credible space for sharing information has pushed critics of the government to the fringes of social media . amid the burst of optimism and civil society activism in the early heady days of the @entity13 in 2011 , @entity1 was often cited as a possible democratic model for countries in the @entity14 . many of those @entity15 countries have since descended into conflict , repression and instability . in the meantime , @entity1 feels increasingly vulnerable to demons of its own making .',\n",

button issue in @entity15 , with the @entity15 @entity16 attacking the conservative - led coalition government for being soft on allowing foreigners into the country . similarly , the opposition @entity17 in @entity1 opposed @entity2 , accusing it of enticing migrants . if the first few months of this year are any guide , demand has not diminished even if the prospect of being rescued has . people from @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 are among the tens of thousands trying to escape repression , violence and abject poverty . despite the danger , the great majority head first for @entity21 , where the collapse of authority allows smuggling operations to go unhindered . @entity1 -- the @entity4 state whose territory is closest to @entity21 -- has borne the brunt of the task of picking up , sheltering and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants . in 2014 , 170,000 migrants arrived in @entity1 by sea . @entity1 ships have picked up about 11,000 migrants in the past week alone . the islands of @entity22 and of @entity23 ( which is closer to @entity24 than to mainland @entity1 ) see an almost daily influx of human misery . and at this time of year , there is a surge in the illegal trafficking as the weather and sea conditions improve . @entity1 prime minister @entity25 has said the @entity3 is a sea , not a cemetery . on sunday , in the wake of the latest disaster , he complained that @entity1 had been coping with the crisis in \" near solitude , sometimes assisted by some other international presence . \" @entity1 has also led calls for an international peacekeeping issue to help restore stability in @entity21 , not least in an effort to tackle the flow of migrants , many of whom set out from around @entity26 and other ports in the west of the country . according to some human rights groups , the danger to migrants on the high seas has been accentuated by merchant ships turning a blind eye to boats in distress -- despite a maritime obligation to come to the aid of vessels in peril . after the latest sinking , the @entity27 called an urgent meeting of foreign and interior ministers , saying that \" the reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold . these are human lives at stake , and the @entity8 as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act . \" @entity8 foreign policy chief @entity28 , who is @entity1 , said sunday : \" we need to save human lives all together , as all together we need to protect our borders and to fight the trafficking of human beings . \" the task could not be \" left only to the southern countries , \" she insisted . but bold action is rarely a hallmark of the @entity8 . the recently installed head of the @entity27 , @entity29 , has set out his priorities -- but they are yet to be acted upon . @entity29 said the current budget of @entity9 - some 90 million euros ( $ 97 million ) - was \" a good start but does not yet equal the task of protecting @entity4 \\'s common borders . \" that money has to cover all @entity9 \\'s roles -- and it \\'s not only the @entity1 coast that is being targeted by migrants . further east , thousands of migrants are trying to reach @entity30 by land and sea . according to the @entity31 \\'s refugee agency , 219,000 refugees and migrants crossed the @entity3 last year . @entity29 has also argued for greater assistance to the @entity32 , which is based in @entity33 , arguing for \" more thorough risk assessments to spot problem areas before they become overloaded . \" most controversially , @entity29 is proposing @entity4 adopt a common asylum system , saying that \" one and the same applicant for asylum can have a 70 - 75 % chance of being granted asylum in one country of the @entity8 and less than 1 % , with the same reasons , in another country . \" but progress toward a @entity4 - wide approach on migration is painfully slow . the @entity27 plans to publish a policy document next month , but member states are in no hurry to grapple with such a politically explosive and costly subject . in the meantime , the argument in @entity4 meetings is likely to focus on priorities , with some ( the @entity15 and @entity34 ) likely to argue that more resources must be devoted to cracking down on the lucrative people - smuggling racket . \" we must target the traffickers who are responsible for so many people dying at sea and prevent their innocent victims from being tricked or forced into making these perilous journeys , \" said @entity15 foreign secretary @entity35 sunday . others , including @entity1 , @entity30 , @entity36 and @entity37 , are expected to seek more concerted action in handling and funding the influx . but the hundreds of migrants being herded onto barely seaworthy boats from @entity21 beaches will be oblivious to the debate . read more : migrant deaths at sea -

at the outbreak of the @entity16 , the @entity17 was already a century and a half old . generations of @entity18 had helped govern @entity15 long before the @entity1 was born . but if @entity14 was , first and always , a @entity15 , @entity2 was an @entity1 . his father came from @entity15 , his grandfather hailed from @entity19 , and before that , the family had probably lived in @entity20 . @entity21 himself had been born in @entity22 and had moved as a boy to @entity23 , and later , as a young man , to @entity3 . these latter two @entity4 states had undeniably been formed by the @entity10 itself . these places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all @entity1 -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life . when young @entity21 moved to @entity23 , it was just becoming a state , thanks to federal governmental action . it was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the @entity24 and countless other @entity25 to leave the @entity22 for a brighter future in the @entity4 . retracing @entity2 \\'s assassination 150 years later that brighter future also involved freedom from slavery . the @entity26 had always been free soil , as provided for by a @entity27 that predated the @entity1 @entity12 . the words of the 13th amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that @entity2 would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in @entity1 and did so by borrowing verbatim from @entity28 6 of the @entity27 . true , geography is not inexorable destiny . many other midwesterners in @entity2 \\'s era embraced slavery and secession . @entity29 , the @entity30 justice who did the most to make @entity2 \\'s constitutional vision a reality over the next century , was born and raised in @entity31 . but geographic variation has always been a large part of @entity1 \\'s constitutional saga . in the 1860 election that brought him to power , @entity2 swept almost all the @entity32 states , but did miserably in the slaveholding south . @entity33 , the dastard who ended @entity2 \\'s life 150 years ago this week , was an embittered extremist from a slave state . so was @entity2 \\'s nemesis on the @entity30 , chief justice @entity34 . @entity34 \\'s most infamous ruling , the pro-slavery @entity35 decision in 1857 , had emerged from a court dominated by the @entity36 ; although slave states accounted for less a third of @entity1 \\'s free population , this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court . remembering @entity2 \\'s murder in our era , given the fact that @entity37 appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years , the court has been rather moderate . much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern @entity37 on the @entity30 -- most notably , @entity38 \\'s @entity39 , @entity3 \\' @entity40 , and @entity41 \\'s @entity42 . all nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal @entity20 , at @entity43 or @entity44 , and the @entity37 appointee most attentive to gay rights , @entity45 , grew up in northern @entity46 , a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles . which takes us back to @entity2 . when @entity45 was a lad in @entity46 \\'s state capital , the governor , a friend of the @entity45 family , was a @entity2 @entity37 named @entity47 -- a man who would later author the @entity30 \\'s iconic opinion in @entity48 , vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by @entity2 and his allies . today , both parties at their best claim @entity2 . @entity49 aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and @entity50 is a @entity22 who professes interest in racial outreach . @entity51 was born an @entity3 @entity37 . and the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from @entity3 who knows how to give a good speech , and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating @entity2 \\'s geographic coalition , winning every state within a four - hour drive of @entity52 . in the largest sense , then , all @entity1 , of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in @entity3 -- are living in the @entity3 .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 is all in . the @entity2 senator from @entity3 has announced that he is seeking the @entity2 presidential nomination , running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the @entity4 . with his youthful energy and @entity5 roots , it \\'s tempting to see @entity1 as the new blood that the @entity2 needs in order to compete against @entity6 in 2016 . yet @entity1 has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues : immigration reform and @entity7 relations . he holds little appeal to @entity5 voters . and unless he can offer new ideas , his climb to the @entity2 nomination will be steep . back in 2013 , @entity1 was a member of the @entity8 \" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform , including a path to citizenship for the nation \\'s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants . he later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from @entity9 , and now says he favors a piecemeal approach , starting with securing the border . his retreat on immigration means that @entity1 has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive @entity2 presidential candidates . that \\'s a shame , for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to @entity5 voters . instead , @entity1 has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration . he believes that president @entity10 \\'s @entity11 program , offering deportation relief to young immigrants , should be ended . he has stated that the president \\'s executive action on immigration , on hold pending a circuit court review , sets a \" horrifying precedent . \" meanwhile , both the @entity11 program and president @entity10 \\'s executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by @entity5 . no wonder the research firm @entity12 reports that , \" we find no evidence that @entity1 \\'s candidacy will draw significant @entity5 support for his candidacy or for his party more generally . \" so , if @entity1 is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow @entity5 , he is mistaken . at a private breakfast monday for supporters , @entity1 described running against \" one candidate in the race who \\'s from yesterday , and one who wants to take us back to yesterday . \" but when it comes to @entity7 policy , @entity1 himself seems firmly stuck in the past . over the weekend , he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous . he has warned that @entity7 is taking advantage of the @entity13 . here , he is an increasingly lonely voice . most @entity13 support better relations with @entity7 , as do a majority of @entity14 . by clinging to the notion that isolating @entity7 is better than engaging with the communist country , @entity1 has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership . immigration and @entity7 policy aside , @entity1 \\'s political philosophy will be a tough sell to @entity5 . he is a fierce opponent of \" @entity15 \" and wants the law repealed . however , the @entity15 has led to a 12.3 % drop in the @entity5 uninsured rate , making @entity16 the demographic with the largest gain in insurance , thanks to the law . ( in fact , @entity1 signed his own family up for \" @entity15 \" on the @entity17 exchange , taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers . ) @entity1 favors smaller government , while @entity16 are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less . and though @entity1 doubts that climate change is caused by humans , the @entity18 has noted that @entity16 view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue . sure , @entity1 is young and charismatic . but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding , @entity1 has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate . in february , he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website @entity19 . another @entity1 weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals . consider that his fellow contender for the @entity2 presidential nomination , sen. @entity20 of @entity21 , has been willing to present new ideas to the @entity2 base , such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana . or that another @entity2 candidate for president , sen. @entity22 of @entity23 is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand . by comparison , @entity1 seems cautious and ill - suited to the task of rousing @entity2 voters . with his early leap into the 2016 race , @entity1 is positioning himself as the next generation of @entity2 leadership . unfortunately , a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for @entity1 , and not for @entity5 voters .',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) this week , @entity1 surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it . she sure pushed the envelope . with her video , new logo and road trip , she opened a long communications campaign not only to \" rebrand \" herself but to completely reframe who she is , what she stands for and how she intends to run . we \\'ll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work . many in the press and on late - night television scratched their heads this week ; others were scathing . @entity2 -- a columnist for the @entity3 -- dismissed her launch video as a \" relentlessly , insultingly vapid \" effort of \" demographic box - checking . \" @entity4 lampooned it as a \" @entity5 commercial gone viral \" and also \" boring as s --- . \" since the media will likely be the stand - in primary opponent for @entity1 , their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter \\'s eyes . but from a marketing perspective , her launch may have been much more successful than critics think . the @entity6 announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate : to flip @entity7 \\'s message from self - absorbed \" i \" to empathetic \" we . \" while critics may sneer , it is hard to deny that the image it projects of @entity1 is more confident , fresher , simpler and forward - looking , with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies , @entity8 and @entity9 . @entity7 \\'s team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past , most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to @entity10 in 2008 . in marketing terms , rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name , term , symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers . reframing is a strategy that goes further : it seeks to change how a consumer ( or voter ) emotionally experiences an established brand . a rebrand may change how you think about a brand ; a reframe may change how you feel about it . in the @entity9 case , the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original @entity11 ; some thought the company was headed for oblivion . but when @entity12 returned as ceo , he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the @entity13 , which not only changed the way consumers thought about @entity9 , but how they experienced it . not only a rebrand -- but a reframe . take @entity1 \\'s road trip to @entity14 in the van nicknamed @entity15 . the press lampooned her , but i would bet that for many others , her unscripted and anonymous stop at @entity16 reinforced the \" everyday @entity17 \" campaign theme . @entity1 stood in line to order , an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast - food chain . also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most - ubiquitous element of her campaign : @entity7 \\'s new and controversial campaign logo . it is a brilliant , iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her , her message and her movement . in fact , her logo is all about movement . simple , confident , high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters , the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue @entity18 says it all : you are the important ones . i \\'m here to support you with everything i \\'ve got . let me help you move forward . taken together , all the pieces of @entity7 \\'s announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but , surprisingly , as one for the future . coincidentally , the way @entity19 announced his run for the @entity20 nomination most likely amplified the impact of @entity7 \\'s reframing . for all his posturing about being the new generation , @entity19 followed to a \" t \" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy : traditional stage and podium , dark suit , bright tie , wife and kids on camera , a live speech , all about himself , timed for the evening news . @entity19 \\'s logo , the signature of his image , drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered , even leaving @entity21 and @entity22 off the map of @entity17 . in stark contrast , @entity1 showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front . it was @entity1 who pulled the ultimate jiu - jitsu . there are those , of course , who will be alienated , if not disgusted , by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan . in a day when voters are yearning for authenticity , how do we know this is the real @entity1 or a candidate in a mask ? fair question . but for better or worse , mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that \\'s where most campaign dollars go . both sides know how to play , sometimes brilliantly . remember the @entity23 advertisements of 1984 , proclaiming \" @entity24 \" ? what we know is that over time , voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through . and if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate , that campaign will get into trouble fast . that \\'s why the key to @entity1 \\'s success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency . she must not only take the essence of a humble , empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication , she must also live it every day . otherwise there will be messaging \" schizophrenia , \" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she \\'ll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008 . in the meantime , one can imagine @entity7 getting a huge , satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts .',\n",

@entity4 : when i was a kid , i had ears that stuck out the side of my head and really big green glasses . and i was tall and lanky and definitely looked a little different than other kids . i think part of the thing that really stuck with me was this feeling of wanting to belong to something , because i just did n\\'t feel like i fit in with the other kids . when i started playing music it really gave me a sense of identity , something that i belonged to , something that i was good at , something that people would watch me do and say , \" oh wow , that \\'s really cool or he \\'s really good at that . \" i think in that way music really gave me an anchor in my social experience . @entity12 : what can students expect when they join your program ? @entity4 : as a new @entity13 student you \\'ll get to try out all the instruments . you \\'ll choose an instrument to learn . you \\'ll be paired with a mentor . and then you \\'ll go throughout that year learning how to play the instrument and music fundamentals and songwriting . and by the end of the year , you \\'ll be performing on stage , recording in a studio and will have a very close relationship with that mentor . our mentors are amazing musicians that are active in the community playing and performing . and some of these mentors are actually from the neighborhoods and the schools that these kids are at currently . we \\'re not policemen . we \\'re not teachers . we \\'re not parents . we \\'re in a unique position to really talk to these kids about the issues that matter most to them . @entity12 : why do you focus on middle schoolers ? @entity4 : it \\'s the time of their life to reach them not only musically , but also as young individuals that are starting to form opinions about who they are and what their world is going to look like . as professional musicians , most of us know what kind of power music has in terms of dealing with the things that are going on in your life . and the reasons that we target the neighborhoods that we have the program in are because these kids are facing the most challenges with being successful in and out of school . a lot of times , these kids only see to the end of their block and back . we like to bring them to studios and also to other places in @entity0 because we want them to experience something outside of their own neighborhood . we also provide them with opportunities to get tutoring and have social services , making sure that they \\'re really successful in and outside of school . @entity12 : i \\'ve heard you play — you \\'re pretty mean on the trombone . how has that passion translated into your work with these kids ? @entity4 : i \\'ve built my life on how important the feeling i get from playing music is . and i thought that that was the end - all , be-all feeling , that being on stage and performing was the thing for me . then i saw a kid have that experience through our program , and it changed everything . there \\'s an amazing sense of pride when i see a kid experience that feeling on stage , where they \\'ve connected with an audience or they get a round of applause because they \\'ve worked really hard and have a great performance . it \\'s an incredible feeling . i was really fortunate to have the opportunities that i did to learn music . and part of me feels very responsible to provide those opportunities for other people , because there were people along the way in my path and my musical journey that helped me . my hopes for the children that we work with are that their vision of the world and their vision of themselves is changed in some way , that they hold themselves to more than other people might , and that they realize there \\'s a whole world out there that they could very much be a part of that is n\\'t necessarily the one right outside their doorstep . i know music has changed my life in a really dramatic way . and i think it \\'s going to change the lives of these students in a really dramatic way . want to get involved ?

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 prime minister @entity2 is scheduled to speak wednesday to a joint meeting of @entity3 . the address marks the first time in history that the head of the @entity1 government will address the entire @entity3 , and given the importance of the @entity4 - @entity1 relationship , it is an invitation long overdue . so far , prime minister @entity2 \\'s appearance has garnered much less attention than last month \\'s speech to @entity3 by @entity5 prime minister @entity6 . this is not surprising ; in a recent survey by the @entity7 nearly three - quarters of the respondents indicated they had \" never heard of \" @entity2 , underscoring just how difficult it is for the @entity8 administration to sell its much - vaunted \" pivot \" or \" rebalance \" to the @entity4 public . nevertheless , @entity2 arrives in @entity9 at an opportune time to help along the economic centerpiece of the \" pivot , \" the @entity10 , or @entity11 . the @entity11 is a potentially massive free trade agreement involving the @entity4 , @entity1 and 10 other @entity12 - facing nations -- combined , these countries account for 40 % of global gdp . and beyond its potential economic impact , it also allows the @entity4 to expand its influence in @entity13 , providing an alternative to @entity14 - centered agreements such as the @entity15 . the stakes , therefore , are significant . but so is some of the opposition to an agreement that has been negotiated in secret . prominent @entity16 such as @entity17 sen. @entity18 and @entity19 sen. @entity20 , for example , have been critical of the @entity11 , arguing that provisions such as one on international arbitration of disputes between investors and states undermine @entity4 sovereignty . but the immediate battle in @entity3 is not over the @entity11 directly , but something called trade promotion authority , or \" @entity21 . \" trade promotion authority , which would allow trade agreements such as the @entity11 to come before @entity3 without amendment , has been on the books for decades . the power to use trade promotion authority , however , must be periodically reauthorized . @entity3 voted narrowly to give president @entity22 trade promotion authority in 2002 , but that authority expired in 2007 and has not been renewed . there is near universal agreement that the current talks can not be concluded unless the @entity3 reauthorizes trade promotion authority , without which the 11 other nations that are parties to the talks can not be confident that the @entity4 speaks with one voice . @entity23 control both houses of @entity3 , and are generally supportive of free trade . but while passage of trade promotion authority in the @entity24 is likely , the result in the @entity25 , where @entity2 will be speaking , is less certain . this is in part because some @entity25 @entity23 are simply loath to delegate any power to the president , while others are certainly aware of the ramifications of the trade promotion authority vote for 2016 . after all , the fact that @entity23 would actually be supporting the proposal of a @entity16 president will not prevent @entity16 -- and their labor supporters -- from using the vote as a weapon to diminish support for @entity23 among those white , working - class voters who were so crucial to @entity23 success in the 2014 midterm . but even if trade promotion authority passes , the fight over the @entity11 is far from over . provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before @entity3 can grant final approval to the @entity11 . this likely throws the @entity11 vote directly into the path of the 2016 presidential race . ironically , the fact that @entity16 seem likely to nominate @entity26 , an early supporter of the @entity11 , may go a long way to blunting this attack . still , it is hard to see @entity27 willing to \" go it alone \" on the @entity11 without some @entity16 buy - in . which brings us back to prime minister @entity2 \\'s speech . given that we are fast approaching the 70th anniversary of the end of @entity28 , there will be an understandable focus on what the prime minister says regarding his nation \\'s role in that conflict . in the eyes of many in @entity14 and @entity29 , @entity1 has never sufficiently apologized for its past transgressions , while the @entity4 itself expressed disappointment over a visit @entity2 made to the controversial @entity30 . yet despite such criticisms , a @entity7 poll found a plurality in the @entity4 thinks that the apologies that @entity1 has issued in the past about the war are sufficient . as a result , for much of the @entity4 audience , @entity2 \\'s words about the @entity11 will be of equal importance to questions of history . so , what will the prime minister say , and will his support for @entity11 be enough to sway @entity3 ? certainly , @entity2 has a lot riding on the agreement domestically ; he has faced opposition from agricultural interests at home who are usually firm backers of his ruling @entity31 , and could be hurt politically if the negotiations collapse . this suggests that the big challenge for @entity2 on wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the @entity11 in a way that convinces the @entity4 people that the trade agreement is not about enriching @entity4 corporations and outsourcing @entity4 jobs , but strengthening the @entity4 - @entity1 alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the @entity4 and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of @entity14 . it \\'s a tall task , especially when it is unlikely the public will be paying much attention to his speech . but it \\'s a deal that will have significant repercussions not just for the deal at hand , but for the success of president @entity8 \\'s pivot to @entity13 . and with that in mind , prime minister @entity2 wo n\\'t be the only one hoping he can turn in a convincing performance on wednesday .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 \\'s controversial religious freedom law has been in hot water lately . after a firestorm of backlash and protests , gov. @entity2 said on tuesday that the state will \" fix \" the @entity3 , or @entity3 , so it will not discriminate against gays and lesbians . @entity2 is making the right call . promoting the false dichotomy between protecting religion versus protecting equality serves no one . not all people who dislike the law hate religion , and not all people who like the law want to discriminate against the @entity4 community . if people of good will come together , liberty and equality can both be saved . the unbelievably easy way to fix @entity1 \\'s @entity3 is to add one small amendment , one easy line codifying that discrimination against the @entity4 community is harmful , and that there is a compelling governmental interest in eliminating that harm . in general , it is a good thing for society to shape its laws in ways that allow people to live their lives consistent with their sincerely held religious obligations . as @entity5 , we value and always have valued the freedom and expression of religion . sometimes , a law seems to impose only modest burdens on the people it affects , but in practice it actually severely burdens the religious practices of a few . in those situations , if there is no compelling governmental interest in enforcing that law in that particularly burdensome way -- and if no one else is harmed -- then religion should be granted an exemption . shifting the burden to the government to prove that it really does need to apply this law in this particular way will not allow every person to become a law unto themselves ; it simply sends the message that religion is important , and unless there are specific and compelling reasons why , people should be allowed to practice as they need . these are the reasons why the federal @entity3 was passed in 1993 , and why it had bipartisan support . these are wholesome @entity5 values that everyone can get behind . the problem is that we no longer live in 1993 , 10 years before @entity6 , and 20 before @entity5 v. @entity7 . in 1993 , our sensibilities were different ; there was not yet a national conversation about the need to protect the rights and dignity of members of the lgbt community . timing matters because society changes , and now that our horizons have been broadened we can not just keep insisting that the law was never intended to discriminate and worked just fine 22 years ago , before we realized its negative potential . even if not a single lawmaker consciously intends the bill to be used as a shield for discrimination , we still have to take seriously justice @entity8 \\' claim about unintended consequences . to put it simply , you have to be concerned with what the law allows a person to get away with . the concern is real . because @entity1 does not have a law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation , the bill as drafted might allow people who were so inclined to discriminate , and simply assert that they could do so based on a religious belief . public perceptions matter . whether or not lawmakers think so , it certainly seems relevant to the general public that this bill was passed with important national decisions about marriage equality on the horizon and right after the ruling in @entity9 v. @entity10 that @entity1 \\'s same - sex marriage ban was unconstitutional . writing for the @entity11 panel in 2014 , judge @entity12 \\'s rationale in the case of @entity9 v. @entity13 provides the obvious answer for how to fix the @entity3 deficiency without changing what it is that it defends . courts have long held that a religious exemption can not be granted if it allows you to shift the harm to a third party , and -- as @entity12 explained so simply -- discrimination is harmful . rfras are not inherently evil . the message can be nondiscriminatory and religion can be protected . the principles of @entity3 can remain unchanged ; it is just the definition of harmful that evolves . a few simple words have the potential to completely change the conversation , send an important message about the value of equality , and make @entity1 into a shining beacon of cooperation : the real \" crossroads of @entity5 . \" doing so would go a long way toward restoring its reputation as a place of great opportunity for all to live and worship and work .',\n",

taking -- not only @entity8 but also @entity13 - @entity2 @entity15 and @entity16 -- may pale in comparison with @entity13 behavior of decades past . but the use of hostages to extract concessions or dampen the enthusiasm surrounding reconciliation is part of a consistent pattern . consider the original @entity13 hostage seizure : on november 4 , 1979 , radical students seized the @entity17 in @entity10 , ultimately holding 52 diplomats hostage for 444 days . often forgotten was what sparked that episode , which occurred more than nine months after @entity18 declared the @entity19 revolution victorious . the problem was a rush to reconcile : at a november 1 , 1979 , @entity20 reception , @entity21 , president @entity22 \\'s national security adviser , met @entity13 prime minister @entity23 . according to @entity21 \\'s own memoir , he told @entity23 that the @entity2 was open to any relationship the @entity19 republic wanted . photos of their handshake graced newspapers around the world . @entity13 hardliners , meanwhile , were apoplectic that @entity24 was \" betraying \" @entity13 \\'s revolutionary principles , and seized the embassy to block any rapprochement . @entity18 endorsed their action . \" our young people must foil these plots , \" he reportedly said . the hostages became pawns in an escalating series of demands . @entity21 \\'s dream of reconciliation became a nightmare . @entity13 released the embassy hostages as @entity25 took his oath of office , ending its first but not last hostage - taking episode . @entity13 proxies seized a number of @entity2 in @entity26 . @entity25 blessed a plan to trade arms for hostages . putting aside the illegalities of diverting weaponry to the @entity27 , the genesis of the scheme was not only a desire for diplomacy but also , much as with @entity1 \\'s outreach today , to solidify the moderate camp within the @entity13 political spectrum . initially , the scheme worked , but no sooner had @entity2 officials delivered the last load of military equipment and the last hostages set free , then kidnappers seized three more @entity2 . hostage - taking had simply become another way to collect concessions . of course , @entity13 is not alone in such games . whenever the @entity2 tries to use diplomacy to bring rogue regimes in from the cold , it faces hostage crises . take @entity28 : @entity1 campaigned as the anti-bush on the world stage . \" the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them ... is ridiculous , \" @entity1 , then a senator , declared in july 2007 . @entity1 had n\\'t even marked two months in office when @entity28 detained two journalists working for @entity29 \\'s current tv . a kangaroo court sentenced @entity30 and @entity31 to 12 years in prison . it was traditional hostage diplomacy . former president @entity32 traveled to @entity33 to appeal for their release . @entity28 leader @entity34 used the episode to solidify the position of his third son and designated successor , @entity35 . @entity28 \\'s police force put out word that \" general @entity35 \\'s artifice let former @entity2 president @entity32 cross the @entity36 to apologize to the @entity37 . it was all made possible thanks to general @entity35 \\'s extraordinary prophecy and outstanding tactics . \" @entity28 \\'s deputy foreign minister confided that the groundwork for the episode had been planned long in advance . @entity30 and @entity38 were neither the first nor the last @entity2 that @entity28 seized during the @entity1 era . after @entity28 torpedoed a @entity39 ship , killing 46 , @entity1 sought @entity28 \\'s censure in the @entity40 . @entity33 responded by threatening @entity41 , an @entity2 imprisoned earlier that year for illegally entering @entity28 . on cue , former president @entity22 arrived to mediate for @entity41 \\' release , called for new talks and , by omission , derailed efforts to hold @entity28 accountable for its killing of nearly four dozen @entity39 sailors . the pattern would repeat in 2012 when @entity28 seized @entity42 , an @entity2 whom @entity35 sought to leverage into concessions . the following year , @entity28 arrested an 85 - year - old @entity43 veteran touring the hermit kingdom and , the next year , took two other tourists hostage . each arrest resulted in a high - level visit , an apology to @entity28 that bolstered the dear leader \\'s claims of strength and renewed engagement . @entity44 likewise worked from the same playbook . in march 1995 , @entity45 security forces seized two @entity2 defense contractors who strayed into @entity45 from @entity46 . sentenced to eight years , they served 114 days before rep. @entity47 , @entity48 , a close @entity32 ally ( and future @entity49 - level @entity40 ambassador ) flew to @entity50 to retrieve them . the @entity2 media lauded @entity47 , but his trip was not without cost : @entity44 used it to depict @entity45 as strong and @entity2 as weak . \" president @entity44 ... accepts the pleas by @entity32 , the @entity51 and @entity2 people , \" the @entity52 reported . and so did the @entity53 . fifteen years before @entity1 traded alleged @entity2 deserter @entity54 for five high - value @entity53 and alleged @entity7 operatives imprisoned at @entity55 , the @entity53 arrested two @entity2 female missionaries . their detention -- and threatened death sentence -- came against the backdrop of @entity32 - era attempts to negotiate with and perhaps even normalize relations with the @entity53 ; the @entity53 , too , knew how holding @entity2 captive could even the playing field or even represent leverage for new concessions . so what does @entity13 \\'s hostage brinkmanship portend ? diplomats drink their own kool - aid , and convince themselves that their engagement can bring rogues in from the cold . ego , ambition and arrogance convince presidents that the failure of past diplomacy rests with their predecessors rather than adversaries . hostages such as @entity8 are canaries in the coal mine , however . their captivity -- not suave officials and their smooth promises -- show both the true character of the regime and its disregard for the norms of diplomacy .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) if there was ever any doubt that the @entity1 administration \\'s @entity2 is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy . nuclear is our largest source of carbon - free energy , generating over 60 % of our carbon - free electricity . surely president @entity1 \\'s climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing the @entity3 \\' overall carbon emissions , would revitalize the nuclear industry , lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets . well , think again . @entity4 , the former head of @entity5 \\'s @entity6 , said in 2013 that \" continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity \\'s ability to avoid dangerous climate change . \" yet wednesday , the @entity7 will celebrate @entity8 and promote its work to fend off climate change , while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration \\'s favorite climate scientists . despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon - free , the @entity1 administration \\'s energy policy plan is biased against it . this bias is created by how @entity9 credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation . @entity9 \\'s modeling is divorced from reality . first , @entity9 \\'s \" @entity10 for the @entity11 \" purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the @entity2 . this base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050 . @entity9 \\'s implementation modeling , \" @entity12 -- @entity13 , \" shows exactly the same situation : no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050 . in other words , @entity9 assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050 . these assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets . a group of @entity14 graduate students made this point to @entity9 at a public hearing last summer . using @entity9 \\'s own data , the graduate students showed that @entity9 \\'s energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants . the students demonstrated that under this scenario , @entity9 \\'s model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase . president @entity1 \\'s @entity9 has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model . for example , when @entity9 modeled the @entity15 - @entity16 bill in 2008 , the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill . @entity9 \\'s modeling of the 2009 @entity17 bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation . where did this policy shift come from ? at a recent hearing in the @entity18 , @entity19 , chairman of the @entity20 , told @entity21 that @entity9 looked at @entity22 \\'s @entity23 when developing its so - called @entity2 and that @entity9 \\'s plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon - free . thus , @entity9 is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon - free energy over others . @entity21 did not give @entity9 the authority to make these choices , so instead they have hidden them in the modeling . for example , the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050 . this is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement . this anti-nuclear bias also is evident in @entity1 \\'s recent executive order \" @entity24 in the @entity25 , \" which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions . even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon - free electricity , the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors . while i have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon , i believe in an all - of - the - above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security , and i have supported legislation that helps to clean the air . the administration says it shares these same interests , despite differing avenues to get there . the administration also believes in man - driven global warming , which should make nuclear energy its golden key . but the @entity2 and the president \\'s recent executive order demonstrate that the @entity1 administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all - of - the - above energy strategy . if you think this administration supports nuclear energy , think again .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , @entity1 channels , even social media platforms like @entity2 and @entity3 -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media . it is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence , though that in itself is liberating . it is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online . it is not unique to @entity4 , but it might seem more pronounced if you live there . going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard . but it still brings resistance , some of it legal , some of it deadly . let \\'s look at the legal angle first . @entity5 , the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail sunday in @entity6 , drew international attention for his @entity7 harangue . but jailing critics is not usually the government \\'s first choice in @entity6 . it is part of @entity8 \\'s legacy that the government \\'s use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases , usually carrying heavy financial penalties , is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices . his father has reportedly apologized for his son \\'s behavior , but the younger @entity5 could face up to three years in jail . @entity5 is not unique . another dissident blogger in @entity6 , @entity9 , continues to suffer financial and legal pressure , including the loss of his job , because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city - state \\'s prime minister , @entity10 , of corruption . @entity9 \\'s concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the @entity11 , the government \\'s compulsory pension program . @entity5 and @entity9 are two of many . the @entity12 \\' file on @entity6 going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases , some against politicians , others against citizens simply frustrated with their government . but it is not just @entity6 where internet activity comes under fire : on monday in @entity13 , with much less of the international attention heaped on @entity5 , five editors and executives from @entity14 were arrested over the site \\'s march 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the @entity15 , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under @entity16 law . in deeply @entity17 @entity13 , questions of @entity16 faith are a third - rail issue , as is revealing government decisions before they are announced . by far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is @entity18 , where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers , most of them @entity19 or @entity20 activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism . but in second place in @entity4 is @entity21 , where @entity12 \\'s most recent prison census showed @entity21 holding 16 reporters behind bars as of december 1 . add one more in late december , @entity22 , a prominent blogger who was arrested for \" law - violating \" after police searched his home in southern @entity23 on december 27 , and two more in january , @entity24 and @entity25 , arrested on anti-state charges of \" abusing democratic freedoms \" and you can see the pattern . because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in @entity21 . only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in @entity21 , their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013 . both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage . the list could go on , but the reality is that , as @entity12 wrote in 2013 , across @entity4 \" governments have curtailed @entity26 freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices , including prohibitive laws , heightened surveillance and censorship , and threats of imprisonment on various national security - related offenses . \" that is still the policy path being followed by most countries in @entity4 , and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon . jailing journalists is one thing , but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another . since 1992 , 11 % of journalists killed have died for their work online . because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the @entity26 , that proportion can be expected to grow . while most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers , @entity27 has recently become the exception . on monday , @entity28 was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in @entity27 in the past five weeks . @entity29 and his wife , @entity30 , were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting @entity31 . @entity29 , a @entity32 citizen of @entity27 origin , was killed and his wife was critically injured . both @entity33 and @entity29 had written critically on @entity16 matters . the blogger death toll gets higher in @entity27 if you go back a year or two , and religious beliefs are always involved , and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity . in january 2013 , blogger @entity34 , who wrote critical commentary on religion , @entity35 groups , free speech , and human rights , barely survived after he was stabbed by @entity16 . in february 2013 , blogger @entity36 , who had written about @entity16 fundamentalism and @entity35 groups , was hacked to death by members of an @entity35 militant group , according to police investigations . later in 2013 , @entity35 groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy . while arrests were made after those murders , there have been no convictions . the bottom line : online journalists , operating outside the restraints of mainstream media , have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors . where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom . where the rule of law is weak , they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom , if ever , answer to the rule of law .',\n",

( at the time i lived far from my home parish . ) i do n\\'t remember how she responded , but the answer about my being able to see @entity3 was clearly no. i do n\\'t know if all @entity4 churches would have shut me out , but i figured , at the time , it was part of the long list of rules the @entity5 required @entity4 leaders to follow . i cried for a bit , then decided i would never ask @entity2 for anything . clearly , his conduits on @entity6 did not have time for me -- a lifelong @entity4 -- and sinner -- so why would he ? ever since , i \\'ve considered myself a lapsed @entity4 . until @entity7 . there is something about @entity7 that \\'s reawakened my faith . and it \\'s not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church . he still argues against things i passionately support , but i find myself -- like many other lapsed @entity8 -- enthralled . recently i had the pleasure of meeting one of the @entity7 \\'s newly appointed cardinals . his name is cardinal @entity9 . the 57 - year - old presides at the @entity10 of @entity11 in @entity12 . one of my first questions : what is it about @entity7 ? \" every person is a mystery you know . ... but what \\'s evident is this man is living with such freedom , such inner freedom . he \\'s himself . he \\'s in tune with the @entity13 , \" @entity9 told me . \" those close to him say he \\'s up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily @entity14 , which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays . so that \\'s almost three hours of prayer , preparation and silence before the @entity13 and the word of @entity2 . wow , that really fine - tunes you to start off a day . \" perhaps that \\'s how the @entity7 stays humble . why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled , women and those of other faiths . why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in @entity15 . all of this is appealing , but it \\'s more than that . in my mind , it \\'s his tone . when pope @entity7 said , \" if a person is gay and he searches for the @entity13 and has good will , who am i to judge ? \" the comment took me aback . homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the @entity5 , yet pope @entity7 uttered those welcoming words . @entity9 likened the @entity7 \\'s approach to @entity16 . \" @entity16 did n\\'t judge . @entity16 did not come as a judge . he came as someone who preached and talked about the love of @entity2 . \" those kinds of answers are so different in my experience , but i understand why more conservative @entity8 worry . if the @entity7 does not judge , then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not ? \" i hear that sometimes , too , \" @entity9 told me . \" i think @entity7 is conservative in the right way . you have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation : that \\'s the @entity17 . you can not reproach @entity7 of not living the @entity17 , or not preaching the truth of the @entity17 . \" but is n\\'t homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church ? \" there is room for everyone . the door is open , \" @entity18 insisted . \" of course you know that the @entity8 will never promote same sex marriage , but do we respect homosexual persons ? do we welcome them ? do we accompany them ? of course . but to respect the @entity8 and its teaching , which is based on a long tradition and also the word of @entity2 , we will not go so far as to bless . but that does n\\'t mean we reject . \" that last sentiment -- \" that does n\\'t mean we reject . \" -- did it for me . i finally understood why @entity7 reawakened my faith . i always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins . like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish . like not covering my head with a traditional veil at @entity19 . like accidentally eating meat on holy friday . like supporting the use of contraception . but as @entity9 told me , @entity16 walked with sinners until the very end . he did not banish them to fires of hell , for he refused to give up on anyone . the @entity20 \\'s last words to me : \" i \\'m trying to do my best on ( the ) local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing . to see how we can today respond to those needs . i want people to see me , and the church , as an open heart to grow together . not a church that \\'s imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose : the lord @entity16 and his @entity17 . \" i ca n\\'t wait to go church next sunday . and , yes , i will bow my head and pray for forgiveness , and if i \\'m worthy , @entity16 \\'s love .',\n",

       "  '@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) it is a strangely detached scene for the close of @entity3 \\'s longest war : military trainers bouncing between multi-million dollar , high security bases , on @entity4 , miles from the front line . but it is how @entity5 wants this to be . and even though the departure of @entity3 troops will be fractionally slower , they will all be inside the @entity3 embassy by the end of next year , making these some of their last weeks outside of the wire . we are near @entity6 , at a regional logistics hub for the @entity1 police force -- a generous facility that was originally intended to resupply the entire east of the country with uniforms , ammunition , even fuel for vehicles . the intentions , first hatched in 2011 when the @entity3 had tens of thousands of troops and still large ambitions for their war here , were large in scale . but the project has been handed between rotations of @entity3 officers and is perhaps a little distant from its first conception . we are taken on a proud tour of a series of clean and newly painted blocks . dozens of @entity1 police gather there , and mill around , waiting for their commanders to arrive . @entity7 \\'s @entity1 series : @entity1 forced to marry her rapist yet a few problems are immediately visible . there are no doorhandles on the outer doors -- we \\'re told they \\'ve been removed while a new master key is being sought . there seem to be few supplies in the actual hub . we ask the @entity1 policemen how many of them get resupplied there , at this stage , four months since it opened , and they say : none . about 20 units a month file paperwork for resupply in the base , but supplies often still come from where they did before -- @entity0 . @entity3 officials told us they are optimistic the logistical road ahead can be smoothed -- that in the 18 plus months they have left they can get the @entity1 army and police up to furnishing themselves with the supply lines they need . but here , now , that seems far away . as does the base , incidentally . it \\'s quite a rough drive from the main road , surrounded by hills , and with at best patchy cellphone coverage -- far from ideal for a transit hub . @entity7 \\'s @entity1 series : @entity8 recruits in @entity9 territory and it is far away in terms of its cost . like so much in the most costly of wars , its price tag may have made sense in briefings on @entity10 , where effectiveness is gauged in millions , but here in dusty eastern @entity1 , it seems exorbitant . this as - yet , partially functional resupply hub cost $ 21 million , a price that presumably includes new doorhandles . there are about fifty @entity1 police currently on the base -- meaning each one has so far cost $ 400,000 to the @entity3 taxpayer . but this is an unfair way of representing the challenge the @entity3 trainers here face : working , as they are , against a clock , with diminishing resources and public interest , in an endlessly complex and often corrupt land where , when the @entity9 are n\\'t thriving , @entity8 are waiting in the wings to fill the gap . with the clock ticking in the background , @entity3 officer colonel @entity11 remains upbeat : \" it \\'s going to be a challenge , to get all those little hubs and spokes -- logistics to maintenance , supplies , resupply . i \\'m optimistic though ; much of this did n\\'t exist in november . \" on the outskirts of the base are the relics of the @entity3 \\'s military involvement in a conflict that still continues to kill @entity1 security forces at an accelerated rate . suvs , even old @entity3 humvees -- now gifted to @entity1 police to drive around -- lie disabled by mine strikes . the @entity3 were hoping the police could stack the vehicles here , assess their resupply needs , or cannibalize the damaged vehicles for spare parts . throughout , the surreal changes in how this war was , and continues to be , fought are omnipresent . years ago , the threat would have mostly been from insurgents taking potshots at an @entity3 base . now we are far from the threat , but another has taken its place . surrounding our crew at all times are \" @entity12 \" -- @entity3 soldiers on guard duty , protecting their own from rogue @entity1 police or soldiers , trying to prevent the newest and most serious scourge -- \" green on blue \" attacks , in which @entity1 security forces turn their guns on @entity3 . it is a strange experience to be protected from those who @entity3 seeks to hand the country over to . but this is how the war ended . not with ideological victories , or dramatic withdrawals , just the slow and deliberate stepping to one side .',\n",

where is the harmony when the average white household has 13 times the wealth of its black counterpart ? and we know the impact wealth has on education , housing and mortality . now there is video of police in @entity27 , @entity28 , celebrating the beating of a suspect as he sits nearby with broken ribs , a head injury and bleeding . the officers fist pump and laugh . one of them even appears to joyfully re-enact parts of the incident in plain view of @entity29 , the man in custody . and when the incident in question was under investigation , the @entity30 suppressed the video . two months would go by before the public saw what we are paying for . but at least we saw it . in @entity31 , the police department has yet to release dash cam video of the fatal encounter officers had with 17 - year - old @entity32 last october . the report said an officer fired shots into @entity32 \\'s chest after the teen lunged at them with a knife . witnesses said the shooting was unjustified . the autopsy shows @entity32 was shot 16 times from a variety of angles by the officer . the @entity33 recently approved a $ 5 million settlement but maintains there was no wrongdoing . the video could shed some light on what really happened ... which may explain why we have yet to see it . this comes on the heels of mayor @entity34 establishing a $ 5.5 million reparations fund for victims of former @entity35 commander @entity36 . for three decades @entity36 and his team ran a torture ring that used electric shock , burned and beat up more than 100 black men . and some look at @entity11 and the protests happening all around the country and wonder where all of this rage is coming from ? this mistrust did n\\'t come from somewhere . it \\'s always been here . woven in the comedic deliveries of @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 ; saturated within the prose of @entity40 , @entity41 and @entity42 ; heard in soulful cries of @entity43 \\'s \" @entity44 \" to @entity45 standing on an @entity46 stage singing \" one day , when the glory comes it will be ours . \" for decades , the works of black artists have explicitly talked about the baltimores of this country and though their work has been celebrated and curated , the message remains lost . why else would someone believe sagging pants and hoodies are to blame for mass incarcerations ? that president @entity6 is the reason why some blacks are frustrated with police and not the dynamic beautifully captured by @entity1 75 years ago . before president @entity47 started the war on drugs . before @entity48 started selling loose cigarettes in @entity49 . before @entity11 became the setting of a critically acclaimed tv show . there is n\\'t a new reason why @entity50 \\'s death triggered outrage . just new ways for people to validate apathy and explain away racism .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 president @entity2 \\'s recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the @entity3 is far from reassuring to the region . in his interview with @entity4 from the @entity5 on april 4 , @entity2 explained @entity1 foreign policy moves on @entity6 and @entity7 , which @entity4 described as the \" @entity2 doctrine . \" he stated that \" we will engage , but we preserve all our capabilities . \" by capabilities , the president must mean the tools , whether diplomatic , economic or military , to protect and defend @entity1 interests . the doctrine is significant because it provides greater clarity about the @entity1 policy under the rest of @entity2 \\'s presidency . instead of the \" new beginning \" that the president outlined in his much discussed @entity8 speech in 2009 , @entity1 policy in the @entity3 remains mired in a contradiction between principles and action on the ground . for example , the president asserted in the interview that \" the @entity1 \\'s core interests in the region are not oil , are not territorial ... our core interests are that everybody is living in peace , that it is orderly , that our allies are not being attacked , that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them , that massive displacements are n\\'t taking place . \" yet , at the very moment that the president was offering this assessment , @entity1 allies , such as the @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and the legitimate government in @entity12 , found themselves under serious threat and attack ; the @entity13 regime was continuing to relentlessly bomb its own citizens ; and the @entity3 was faced with the biggest refugee crisis in its history . implementing the core @entity1 interests outlined by @entity2 in the interview is clearly not working . there exist grave doubts about whether the current @entity1 administration is indeed ready to deploy the above - mentioned \" capabilities . \" it seems that the @entity1 will only use them when its national security is at stake . and those core interests are limited to dealing with terrorism and nuclear proliferation only and not the broader aspects mentioned by the president . the use of drone technology across the region , the military strikes being conducted against @entity14 in @entity15 and @entity13 and the framework agreement between @entity6 and six world powers on the @entity6 nuclear programs are cases in point . establishing a region \" living in peace \" is clearly not an instance where those capabilities will be deployed and is not part of the so - called @entity2 doctrine . in the same vein , the majority of the @entity16 world and the entire @entity17 region look at the recently announced @entity6 nuclear deal with a sense of suspicion and trepidation . having directly experienced the problematic interventionist @entity6 policies for decades , the @entity16 world is simply not ready to give @entity18 the benefit of doubt on any regional issue . but neither is it ready to trust @entity1 assurances that outside a nuclear agreement , the @entity1 will indeed put forward a concerted strategy to contain @entity6 influence throughout the region or to defend the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) states against any @entity6 threat . instead , the fear is that as long as @entity6 abides by any agreement that might come into force later this year , the @entity1 will negate , downplay , or simply ignore those @entity6 actions that the @entity16 world considers as direct threats . here , actions speak louder than words and unfortunately one sees only the latter coming from @entity20 . at a time when the region is faced with unprecedented turmoil and transition , the president even shifted the blame and directed his criticism toward the @entity16 world . when he referred to \" our @entity16 @entity21 allies \" the president gave an exaggerated picture by saying \" populations that , in some cases , are alienated , youth that are underemployed , an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic , and in some cases , just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances . \" what @entity2 failed to do is to highlight that this statement is in fact also applicable to @entity6 . in his interview , he never questioned @entity6 \\'s appalling record on human rights , treatment of the political opposition , and minorities \\' rights , among other disturbing issues . moreover the reference to @entity22 being one of the \" @entity16 allies \" ignores the fact that there are @entity23 living in the @entity16 @entity17 and adds to the existing destructive sectarian tensions as well as the sensitivity of the @entity24 . equally , the assertion that \" the biggest threats that they ( the @entity21 states ) face may not be coming from @entity6 invading . it \\'s going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries ... \" is another example of the detachment from reality . based on a @entity25 study , when there are 48 militia groups supported by @entity6 operating in @entity15 and tearing apart the very social fabric of that country , it is simply naive to suggest there is no @entity6 threat . the bottom line here is that @entity1 and @entity16 national security interests are no longer on the same page . ever since the @entity1 - led invasion of @entity15 in 2003 , those interests have increasingly diverged to the point that the @entity16 world is tired of false promises . the ongoing operation of ten mostly @entity21 coalition countries to protect the legitimate government of @entity12 is simply the latest move that underlines the determination of @entity21 countries to take matters in their own hands . the @entity19 states may accept the invitation by the @entity1 president to come to @entity26 , his @entity27 country retreat , and have an honest discussion with him about the situation in the region . but they question the value of being invited for purposes of being reassured when they are already being informed beforehand of what is wrong with them . the truth of the matter is that \" the region is ( not ) working \" and that misguided @entity1 leadership and policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region . unfortunately , the \" @entity2 doctrine \" does little to change this and may in fact make matters worse .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 is unique on the @entity2 calendar , a major point in the cycle of the religious year , and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds @entity3 . that \\'s in part because @entity1 is genuinely about how religious impulses , and patterns , can operate in ways that affect our lives . nevertheless , i \\'m often surprised by how little people , even those supposedly within the @entity2 tradition , actually know about what is called @entity4 and its culmination on @entity5 . at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics ( and tolerance ) that have profound religious implications , it \\'s worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition , in all its sadness and glory , that it engenders . after all , @entity4 calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent . still , the fuss must puzzle those looking on , wondering what it all means . why do @entity6 make so much of this springtime week , and make so much of @entity1 weekend ? there is a phrase that many never come across , even among @entity6 : @entity7 . this refers to the three days of @entity1 that begin with @entity8 , proceed through @entity9 , and conclude with @entity5 . it \\'s definitely a progression , although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer . @entity7 has a kind of major prologue in @entity10 , the day when , by tradition , @entity11 celebrated the @entity12 with his disciples in the upper room in @entity13 on the night before he was crucified . the idea of @entity14 begins with this meal , which was a @entity15 meal . @entity11 , of course , was @entity16 , as were all his disciples . he was never trying to erase @entity17 and found a new religion . his work involved modifying and extending @entity17 in fresh ways . on @entity10 , @entity6 sometimes practice the washing of feet , recalling that @entity11 washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the @entity12 as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior . @entity8 is n\\'t , in fact , so good . it \\'s the day of the crucifixion , when @entity11 was scourged and beaten , forced to carry his cross to @entity18 , the \" place of the skull , \" and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death . the actual scene of the @entity19 varies from gospel to gospel , as do his last words , assembled into the so - called \" seven last words \" of @entity11 by adding up fragments from different gospels . some of these words are quotations , as when @entity11 asked @entity20 why he has abandoned him : this is a quote from the 22nd @entity21 , which opens : \" my @entity20 , my @entity20 , why hast thou forsaken me ? \" @entity8 is a day of death , sacrifice , displacement , fear . @entity9 is probably the least understood day of the @entity7 . it \\'s a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of @entity1 . this day occupies an anxious space in human experience , when the certain knowledge of something dreadful is n\\'t quite erased -- ca n\\'t be erased -- simply by hope . it \\'s a day of depression , a day of suspension . then comes @entity1 , with the aura of the resurrection . i \\'m always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment , when the body of @entity22 becomes what is called a \" glorified body . \" this was not , as i \\'ve said elsewhere , the @entity23 , although that \\'s part of it , too . @entity24 implies a total transformation , something beyond the physical realm . it \\'s very important that almost nobody who encounters @entity11 after the resurrection can really recognize him , know him , or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified . @entity1 embraces the great mystery of resurrection , with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another , and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding . the three days of @entity1 , the @entity25 , occur only once a year on the calendar . but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again . we find ourselves emptied out in small ways , nailed to our own trees in life , embarrassed or broken by life . it was the @entity26 who famously observed that life is suffering . @entity8 embodies the @entity2 version of that truth . @entity11 suffered in the way all of us must suffer . we must all die , perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly . our friends and families must die . we all experience illness , loss , sadness , a loss of confidence , darkness . this is simply part of the human experience . we dive again and again into holy saturday , too -- a period of transition , when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view . we know well this in - between time ; it \\'s an anxious passage , with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope . and we \\'ve all been resurrected , again and again , perhaps in tiny ways . this is the joy of @entity1 , and it \\'s not something reserved for one day on the calendar . it \\'s there whenever we experience what @entity27 once called the \" timeless moment , \" which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself . it \\'s a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time . i suspect we all experience the @entity25 frequently , sometimes more than once in a single day . but the ritual enactment of these three days of the @entity1 season reminds all of those who practice @entity2 -- and perhaps those who do n\\'t -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light . it \\'s a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression . it \\'s good cause for celebration , too : and one that wo n\\'t easily be co-opted by secular culture .',\n",

minute video in february showing the mass murder of @entity56 from @entity57 . produced by the @entity35 \\'s propaganda wing @entity58 , the video shows black - clad jihadists standing behind their victims on a @entity28 beach . some of the hostages cry out \" oh @entity59 \" and \" oh @entity60 \" as they are pushed to the ground , just before they take their final breaths . \" the sea you have hidden sheikh @entity61 \\'s body in , we swear to @entity30 , we will mix it with your blood , \" a masked man says in @entity62 before the beheadings . news of this mass beheading emerged weeks after 21 @entity57 @entity4 were kidnapped in two incidents in the @entity28 coastal city of @entity63 . the @entity1 video shows the beheading of around a dozen men , though @entity57 officials say all 21 kidnapped @entity4 were killed . @entity57 \\'s government responded with airstrikes on 10 targets used for training and storage in @entity1 \\' @entity28 stronghold of @entity64 , according to @entity57 foreign minister @entity65 . \" avenging @entity57 blood and punishing criminals and murderers is our right and duty , \" the @entity57 military said in a statement that was broadcast on state television . modern -

established reputation of offering little to no mercy to @entity4 . the number of @entity4 in @entity33 has plummeted -- from 1.5 million some 20 years ago to some 300,000 today , according to estimates from @entity69 , the largest @entity13 relief organization in northern @entity33 . @entity1 is n\\'t the only reason for this drop , but it certainly is a big one . the militant group has been brazen in its onslaught in @entity33 as well as @entity19 , with @entity4 among its targets . that includes its taking over @entity33 \\'s largest @entity13 city , the mostly @entity66 community of @entity70 , in august 2014 . @entity1 has inflicted pain and suffering well beyond @entity70 , though , like its capture and control of @entity71 , @entity33 \\'s second - largest city . the group \\'s advance there prompted @entity13 families to flee rather than adhere to the ultimatum of converting to @entity34 , paying a fine or facing \" death by sword . \" @entity72 , a @entity73 -

       "  '( @entity0 ) there are two paths to practicing medicine in @entity1 . there \\'s the traditional , time - tested way , where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians . then there \\'s the approach being forged in @entity2 and @entity3 : getting elected to a state legislature . lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice . in 2011 , @entity2 enacted the @entity4 , which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety . guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk . asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry . i treat brain injuries , and it \\'s part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them , like driving . and handling weapons . some of those i treat suffered their injuries by bullets , typically fired by family members or themselves . does anyone really believe i should n\\'t talk about gun safety in these cases ? it \\'s a good thing i do n\\'t practice in @entity2 . @entity2 \\'s gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it , and while a three - judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer , doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th @entity5 decides whether it will take up the case , a decision that could come down any day , the president of the @entity2 chapter of the @entity6 , dr. @entity7 , told me . he is a plaintiff in the case . in @entity3 , another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer . @entity8 goes a step beyond silencing doctors . it requires them to lie . the bill was originally a hum - drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services , a common state and federal strategy . but legislators slid in a last - minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill @entity9 tell patients the pill is reversible . that \\'s the opinion of a particular @entity10 doctor who says this can be done through risky , large doses of progesterone . but the doctor has n\\'t proven his case , and his regimen is not recommended by the @entity11 or the @entity12 . any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the @entity10 regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients , but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient - doctor relationship . i can not imagine anyone attempting to put words into the mouth of a lawyer privately consulting with a client . why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the @entity13 would never permit ? dr. @entity14 , chairwoman of the @entity3 chapter of the @entity11 , told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the @entity15 . while @entity16 and the @entity17 joined her organization in criticizing the provision , the bill passed both chambers and was recently signed by the governor . there \\'s a common relationship shared by these laws , beyond turning doctors into government spokespeople . these laws capitalize on controversial issues to divide and conquer . physicians do n\\'t all share the same opinions on abortion and guns any more than they all vote @entity18 or @entity19 . this is part of the reason the key state physicians \\' associations are n\\'t taking the lead in battling these laws . the battle is left to the specialties most affected . in @entity2 , that \\'s the state \\'s chapter of the @entity6 , since pediatricians are most likely to ask about guns in the home . in @entity3 , it \\'s the state chapter of the @entity11 carrying the torch for physician free speech . the @entity20 did n\\'t provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law , and the @entity21 told me in a statement that \" @entity22 \\'s policy is to take no position on abortion . \" representing physicians as a whole , the state medical associations have the most political clout in statehouses . the @entity23 ( @entity24 ) tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate \" @entity25 \" to the issue of physician free speech , highlighting the threat posed by @entity2 \\'s gun law in particular . members are concerned about the precedent being set . @entity26 enacted a law similar to @entity3 just days later . the @entity27 can do more . it did file a friend - of - the - court brief as part of the @entity2 legal challenge , but at this writing has n\\'t weighed in on @entity3 . the @entity22 did n\\'t sign on to a statement released last week by the @entity28 to protect the patient - provider relationship that hits hard on the new abortion laws as an affront to good medical care . its huge lobbying operations are tied up in @entity29 , while states are the main battleground over the integrity of medical practice . now that the @entity22 has won the age - old \" doc fix \" battle , ending automatic @entity30 payment cuts to doctors , perhaps it will consider assigning some of its $ 18 million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who \\'ve abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession . we have a surgeon general now , @entity31 , and he is on a national listening tour while he prepares to announce his areas of policy focus on april 22 , @entity32 , a @entity33 spokesman told me . i hope @entity31 will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health -- free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) a year ago @entity1 published a story with the following headline : @entity2 , a @entity3 , mulls 2016 run for president . the story ticked off items on @entity2 \\'s conservative things - to - do list while also noting his close ties to the deep - pocketed @entity3 brothers , as well as other right - wing lobbying groups . last august the @entity4 governor was in @entity5 for an @entity6 event ; the group is backed by the conservative @entity3 brothers , and supported gov. @entity2 \\'s tax - slashing budget . now , @entity2 is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians . why would @entity2 ignore the pleas of @entity4 \\'s @entity7 as well as the @entity8 mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? because there \\'s a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was @entity2 \\'s way of shoring up his street cred . it is also the reason why @entity8 @entity9 , @entity2 \\'s fellow @entity10 hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend @entity2 and the law . one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same - sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . backlash aside , the fact is @entity2 has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives . and while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump , the very public debate that now embroils him — and @entity11 gov. @entity12 , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire @entity8 field farther to the right than the party had hoped . @entity2 : \\' was i expecting this kind of backlash ? @entity13 no. \\' for there is no way a @entity8 can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous @entity14 into single - issue voters . i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . instead it looks like it \\'s going to be dragged down to a replay of @entity15 \\'s \" cultural war \" speech , during which he told the @entity16 : \" we stand with ( @entity17 ) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women \" and later followed with \" there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the @entity18 itself . for this war is for the soul of @entity14 . \" progressives may enjoy watching @entity2 \\'s temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen. @entity19 of @entity20 , who has indicated a federal ban on same - sex marriage is not off the @entity8 table . and even if you think neither @entity2 nor @entity9 nor @entity19 will win the nomination , someone has to . in light of that , listen to conservative former @entity11 gov. @entity21 , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives \\' discomfort with same - sex marriage : \" it \\'s like asking someone who \\'s @entity22 to start serving bacon - wrapped shrimp in their deli . \" or @entity23 gov. @entity24 : \" i certainly will support @entity19 and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . \" or @entity25 gov. @entity26 , who has a long history of fighting against same - sex marriage and civil unions . and @entity27 said jail turns people gay , so there \\'s that . remember : @entity2 did n\\'t act alone . he only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials . in fact , according to the @entity28 , \" the @entity29 [ @entity30 ] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment . \" who supports , denounces @entity4 law ? @entity31 may suggest voters nationwide are more gay - friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we \\'re witnessing the final gasp of long - ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . former rep. @entity32 of @entity33 , the first member of @entity34 to marry someone of the same sex while in office , said he believes @entity8 want the @entity35 to rule in favor of same - sex marriage to provide political cover in the @entity8 primary . \" we \\'re winning , \" he told a crowd in @entity36 recently while promoting his latest book . i guess if you look at where the country was on @entity37 issues 10 years ago , we definitely are . that \\'s assuming you are part of the \" we \" who believe @entity37 people should have the same rights as their heterosexual / cisgender counterparts . but as the situation in @entity4 has shown , \" winning \" should not be mistaken for having \" won . \" for it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so - called \" religious freedom \" bills snaking through red - state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it \\'s raised in a debate or at a campaign stop , especially with @entity8 controlling both the @entity10 and the @entity38 . @entity2 , and to a lesser extent , @entity9 , may be toxic now but @entity14 has a short attention span . more importantly , they are not alone . @entity32 said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . if that holds true in 2016 , \" winning \" is going to feel very strange .',\n",

feet of water ( an acre foot of water equals about 325,000 gallons ) over the next nine months , state officials said . \" this historic drought demands unprecedented action , \" @entity3 said , standing on a patch of dry , brown grass in the @entity4 mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow . the reduction in water use does not apply to the agriculture industry , except for the requirement that it report more information on its groundwater use . the exclusion prompted some criticism , as agriculture uses about 80 % of @entity2 \\'s developed water supply . farms in the state have taken a hit , with reduced water allocations and thousands of farmworkers laid off . but climate writer @entity5 of @entity6 wrote that \" wasteful agriculture is literally sucking @entity2 dry . \" the action comes as the @entity4 snowpack , which @entity2 rely on heavily during the summer for their water needs , is near a record low . one famed golf course group said it should be able to keep its fairways and greens green . @entity7 , an executive vice president of the @entity8 company , said his company is studying the restrictions to see what effect it will have on business . \" it will not affect our golf course irrigation because we use recycled waste water ( for golf course irrigation ) from a plant we built in 1994 , \" he said . the company operates @entity9 , @entity10 and the links at @entity11 as well as three hotels . he said the drought has yet to hurt revenue . \" people up here are also very conscious about water usage and the expense of water in this area , \" he said . @entity12 in @entity13 , known for its beautiful campus , said it would be challenging to meet the restrictions given the water - saving practices already in effect . the school already uses recycled and reclaimed water for campus irrigation and now it has turned off all fountains on campus , according to @entity14 , director of the university \\'s @entity15 . the university was also encouraging students to further reduce water usage . in addition , @entity3 \\'s executive order will : impose significant cuts in water use on campuses , golf courses , cemeteries and other large landscapes . replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with \" drought - tolerant landscaping . \" create a temporary , statewide consumer rebate program to replace old appliances with water efficient models . prohibit new homes and developments from irrigating with potable water unless water - efficient drip irrigation systems are used . @entity16 watering of ornamental grass on public street medians . require agricultural water users to report more water use information to state regulators , increasing the state \\'s ability to enforce against illegal diversions and waste . \" it \\'s a different world , \" @entity3 said wednesday . \" we have to act differently . \" a staggering 11 trillion gallons are needed for @entity2 to recover from the emergency . the estimate is based on @entity17 satellite data analysis of how much water the state \\'s reserves lack . that \\'s more than 14,000 times the amount of water it would take to fill the @entity18 stadium , according to @entity0 calculations . it \\'s the amount of water that flows over @entity19 in about 170 days \\' time . the entire state faces at least a moderate drought , and more than half of the state faces the worst category of dryness , called an exceptional drought , according to the @entity20 . @entity2 is n\\'t the only state feeling an absence of rain . as of late september , 30 % of the @entity21 faced at least a moderate drought , particularly in the @entity22 states neighboring @entity2 and in @entity23 , the @entity20 says . but none of those states is facing the extremes of @entity2 , where the drought has been a slowly building natural disaster since 2012 . in fact , @entity3 last year declared a state emergency , saying his constituents are facing \" perhaps the worst drought that @entity2 has ever seen since records ( began ) about 100 years ago . \" opinion : the end of the @entity24 lawn on september 16 , @entity3 signed \" historic legislation \" that created \" a framework for sustainable , local groundwater management for the first time in @entity2 history , \" the governor \\'s office said . before the new legislation , @entity2 was the only @entity25 state that did n\\'t manage its groundwater , officials said . last month , @entity3 unveiled an emergency $ 1 billion spending plan to tackle the state \\'s historic drought . according to the @entity26 , the package will specifically accelerate $ 128 million from the governor \\'s budget to provide direct assistance to workers and affected communities . @entity27 1 funding , which enacted the @entity28 , @entity29 , and @entity30 of 2014 , will funnel $ 272 million into safe drinking water efforts and maintenance of water recycling infrastructure . some $ 660 million from @entity31 will also be accelerated for flood protection in urban and rural areas . as part of the changes , @entity3 said additional measures will crack down on water inefficiency as @entity2 enters the fourth year of a worsening water crisis . the march snowpack measurement came in at 0.9 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the march 3 historical average for the measurement site . the overall water content for the @entity32 snowpack came in at 4.4 inches , just 16 % of average for the date . @entity33 and southern @entity34 readings were 5.5 inches ( 20 % of average ) and 5 inches ( 22 % of average ) respectively . only in 1991 has the water content of the snow been lower . @entity0 \\'s @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 contributed to this report .',\n",

because there \\'s a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was @entity2 \\'s way of shoring up his street cred . it is also the reason why @entity8 @entity9 , @entity2 \\'s fellow @entity10 hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend @entity2 and the law . one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same - sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . backlash aside , the fact is @entity2 has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives . and while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump , the very public debate that now embroils him — and @entity11 gov. @entity12 , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire @entity8 field farther to the right than the party had hoped . @entity2 : \\' was i expecting this kind of backlash ? @entity13 no. \\' for there is no way a @entity8 can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous @entity14 into single - issue voters . i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . instead it looks like it \\'s going to be dragged down to a replay of @entity15 \\'s \" cultural war \" speech , during which he told the @entity16 : \" we stand with ( @entity17 ) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women \" and later followed with \" there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the @entity18 itself . for this war is for the soul of @entity14 . \" progressives may enjoy watching @entity2 \\'s temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen. @entity19 of @entity20 , who has indicated a federal ban on same - sex marriage is not off the @entity8 table . and even if you think neither @entity2 nor @entity9 nor @entity19 will win the nomination , someone has to . in light of that , listen to conservative former @entity11 gov. @entity21 , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives \\' discomfort with same - sex marriage : \" it \\'s like asking someone who \\'s @entity22 to start serving bacon - wrapped shrimp in their deli . \" or @entity23 gov. @entity24 : \" i certainly will support @entity19 and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . \" or @entity25 gov. @entity26 , who has a long history of fighting against same - sex marriage and civil unions . and @entity27 said jail turns people gay , so there \\'s that . remember : @entity2 did n\\'t act alone . he only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials . in fact , according to the @entity28 , \" the @entity29 [ @entity30 ] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment . \" who supports , denounces @entity4 law ? @entity31 may suggest voters nationwide are more gay - friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we \\'re witnessing the final gasp of long - ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . former rep. @entity32 of @entity33 , the first member of @entity34 to marry someone of the same sex while in office , said he believes @entity8 want the @entity35 to rule in favor of same - sex marriage to provide political cover in the @entity8 primary . \" we \\'re winning , \" he told a crowd in @entity36 recently while promoting his latest book . i guess if you look at where the country was on @entity37 issues 10 years ago , we definitely are . that \\'s assuming you are part of the \" we \" who believe @entity37 people should have the same rights as their heterosexual / cisgender counterparts . but as the situation in @entity4 has shown , \" winning \" should not be mistaken for having \" won . \" for it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so - called \" religious freedom \" bills snaking through red - state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it \\'s raised in a debate or at a campaign stop , especially with @entity8 controlling both the @entity10 and the @entity38 . @entity2 , and to a lesser extent , @entity9 , may be toxic now but @entity14 has a short attention span . more importantly , they are not alone . @entity32 said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . if that holds true in 2016 , \" winning \" is going to feel very strange .',\n",

@entity3 : our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible . in order to come into the home , you need to have lost both parents , or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect , abuse or have a parent who \\'s incarcerated . we have to conduct a full investigation . so usually that involves going to the child \\'s village , making calls , doing police checks , getting documentation and paperwork . we have to dig up birth certificates , death certificates , make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does . @entity2 : meanwhile , you have 350 children attending your school . what is their background ? @entity3 : every single year we \\'ll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants . and we choose the ones who are the most needful and really wo n\\'t be in school without us . most of them live in one room , a mud hut . a lot of them are just in survival mode . we try to relieve the burden from the family , so that the child has food , medical care , books , zero fees for education . @entity2 : what have you learned working with the local community in @entity1 ? @entity3 : i learned very early on , from the beginning , that i could n\\'t come in and just be like , \" here , i have a vision . this is what we \\'re going to do . \" that does n\\'t work . it has to be slow ; it has to be organic . and it has to come from the community and be a \" we \" thing . it \\'s really important to me that this is a @entity1 project , working for @entity1 , for the community . so the faces that you see are strong @entity1 women and amazing @entity1 role - model men . @entity2 : how does the project continue to grow ? @entity3 : we started with the home and then school . we run the school lunch program . then we needed to keep our kids really healthy , so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center . from there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food . and then from there we decided to start a women \\'s center . we just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off - the - grid campus . this year we converted to solar energy . so we \\'ll have a high school and then a day care , preschool , elementary , all the way up , and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward . it \\'s become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream . it \\'s become a community . and i want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like . want to get involved ?

       "  '@entity0 , @entity1 ( @entity2 ) traveling to @entity1 these days , the mood among many people and the government can probably best be described using two words : confident and optimistic . after a preliminary framework for a possible nuclear deal was reached between @entity1 and world powers , many here believe a final agreement is possible -- and most hope that widespread sanctions relief could be on the horizon . businesses are already gearing up for a time after the restrictions are lifted , and many people anticipate a huge boost to the economy . \" naturally we are all very happy , \" one woman in central @entity0 told us . \" we expect better days economically and culturally . we want better relations with the rest of the world . \" another man added , \" i have a good feeling about it , because my country will be free of the fear of war . \" but this weekend , just a few miles down the road , @entity1 \\'s leaders were celebrating their war machine as the military held its annual @entity3 parade . as the @entity4 , @entity5 and other countries criticize @entity1 for its alleged involvement in funding and supplying the @entity6 rebels who have seized power in much of @entity7 , @entity1 president @entity8 has praised the military as peacemakers for the @entity9 . \" today , our army is the source of our national stability , \" @entity8 said in his speech at the parade . \" and even more than that -- it is also a source of security and stability in the entire region . \" the country \\'s top military brass seemed surprisingly relaxed and unusually willing to speak with western media outlets . major general @entity10 , the chief of staff of @entity1 \\'s armed forces and a man who is close to @entity8 , told @entity2 he hopes the @entity4 and @entity1 can work closer together to fight @entity11 in @entity12 . \" the unity of humanity based on the right of all human beings to live , and their right to freedom , dictates that all human society is threatened by @entity11 , and all humans should unite against @entity11 and work against them , \" @entity10 said . @entity13 also repeated @entity1 \\'s longstanding claim that the @entity4 is partly responsible for creating @entity11 , which now controls large parts of @entity12 and @entity14 . \" if the @entity4 really did n\\'t create @entity11 , and if they want to destroy @entity11 , it is possible for them to achieve that , \" he said . \" but we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the @entity4 and @entity15 . we hope that one day , because of their national interests and the will of their nations , the @entity4 and the @entity15 will decide to really fight @entity11 . \" @entity1 has often dismissed the coalition air campaign as ineffective , while praising its own strategy of training , advising , outfitting and directing @entity16 militias , @entity17 forces and the @entity12 military . but in another apparent softening of rhetoric , a top military official said he hopes that the animosity between @entity1 and @entity4 will fade . \" at the moment , we consider the @entity4 to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us , \" general @entity18 , the commander of @entity1 \\'s ground forces , told @entity2 . \" we would like the @entity4 to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in the @entity4 military leadership , \" @entity18 continued . \" we trust the @entity4 people , but the tone of @entity4 government and military officials is such that we still consider the @entity4 a threat . \" at the same time , @entity1 \\'s leadership is showing no sign of toning down its own fiery rhetoric -- and the usual \" death to @entity19 , death to the @entity4 \" chants echoed around the crowds at the military parade . the @entity4 welcomes some of @entity1 \\'s support for @entity12 forces in the fight against @entity11 , but says at this point that there simply is no basis for deeper cooperation on the battlefield . and for @entity1 \\'s part , @entity20 ayatollah @entity21 has also rejected direct coordination between the two long - time adversaries . and even though many @entity1 have high hopes for the interim nuclear deal , the leadership in @entity22 and @entity0 is far more skeptical . in a recent televised speech , @entity21 said it was possible that there would be no deal by the june 30 deadline -- and possibly no deal at all . and @entity1 \\'s army brass has rejected the notion that nuclear inspectors would get access to military sites . meanwhile , the @entity23 has been confronted by a @entity24 that is largely hostile to the negotiations , and has been making the case that a deal can not be about trust , but about monitoring and verification . \" our main concern here is making sure that if @entity1 does n\\'t abide by its agreement , that we do n\\'t have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops in order to reinstate sanctions , \" @entity4 president @entity25 said last friday . \" that \\'s our main concern . and i think that goal , of having in reserve the possibility of putting back and applying forceful sanctions in the event of a violation , that goal can be met . \" so far none of this has seriously threatened to derail nuclear talks set to resume this week . but despite the confidence and optimism that is currently in the air , there is also fear that things could fall apart if @entity0 and @entity22 are n\\'t willing to make tough concessions .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) @entity1 , my good friend and co-author who got a @entity2 in economics , once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies . one group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure ; the other group , which experienced the same type of colonoscopy , did not . it turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning . the psychology of it is simple to understand : happy endings matter . even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well . so too with taxes . let \\'s just say that when it comes to taxes for the average @entity3 , \" stuff \" happens ( keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running ) , paycheck to tax - reduced paycheck . but recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 @entity3 taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes , and the average amount is close to $ 3000 . that pays for a lot of stuff . to make the good news even better , tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people , with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free . no filing headaches and a check to boot . what \\'s not to like ? the fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the @entity3 tax system . for example , the laws are biased against two - worker marriages ; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry , as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers . taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich , who make their wealth off of their existing wealth , the largely untaxed returns from capital , rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us . but now is not the time to explain such serious matters ; the people are too busy spending their refunds . the once dreaded @entity4 has become a happy spending spree for most @entity3 . this state of short - term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws . in brief , the @entity3 income tax system is increasingly a wage tax , with limited taxes on capital ( what the rich have ) and limited deductions for most of us . for example , 3 out of 4 @entity3 using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions . all of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians , professors and pundits . but who has time for that ? let \\'s go to our television sets and check out the commercials . one clever spot ran during the recent @entity5 , suggesting that the @entity6 -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing , which the sponsor was eager to provide . filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who does n\\'t remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in april , the cruelest month ? now as @entity4 approaches , we are flooded with advertisements about @entity3 getting its billions back , without even having to pay to prepare the forms . we get paid to play ! here is the happy ending that @entity1 and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past . the simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer . service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled @entity3 . of course , these kind souls want their happy endings too . they are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers , the grateful taxpayers - turned - consumers will happily purchase add - on services , such as \" audit protection insurance , \" or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider . just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees , the \" found money \" of tax returns can finance many nice purchases . of course , there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws , biased against modern families and wage earners , and in favor of the rich living off capital . no real bother -- stuff happens . let others fret about fairness . as long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before ?',\n",

in girlfriend , a beautiful and successful daughter and a bank account that was supposed to fund a fast - approaching retirement . his red @entity9 was found abandoned near a bridge on the @entity10 about 55 miles away from his home . months later his county - issued laptop and hard drive were found -- separately -- on the banks of the river , too damaged to read . as far as hard evidence goes , that \\'s about all police have . the best lead they got was the sighting of a woman who has not been identified , and information that he had searched online for ways to destroy a hard drive . what \\'s left is theory , speculation and a case that \\'s been cold almost from the beginning . \" when a district attorney goes missing , you know , it \\'s pretty big . it \\'s going to catch people \\'s attention . a lot of people do n\\'t have a large footprint . this guy had influential friends , he was well known , \" said @entity11 , director of communications and case management for the @entity12 and @entity13 , or @entity14 . from the start , investigators have considered three possibilities : @entity3 committed suicide , fell victim to foul play or deliberately walked away . the prevailing theories have been suicide or walk -

the @entity12 jihad gave rise to the @entity15 in @entity16 and @entity12 , which now uses @entity12 as a rear operating base to support its jihad in @entity16 , which could soon spill over into @entity17 . plus , @entity13 is now being used as a rear operating base by @entity18 and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the @entity4 , even as they plan attacks in @entity9 and @entity19 . given the frightfully slow pace @entity19 \\'s commander - in - chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both @entity18 and its progenitor , @entity20 , the picture of what \\'s in store is clear : the body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy - in for their agendas . and neither the @entity7 nor our @entity21 allies are immune to this cancer . academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of @entity18 and @entity20 as distinctly different . but the fact is they are not -- their agendas , which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today , are manifestations of radical @entity1 . of course , it \\'s hardly a surprise president @entity2 refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven naïve , with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is , but as they hope it could be . there is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the world \\'s most powerful politician and his national security team . just take the @entity22 published by the @entity3 in 2011 . that document contained the assertion that , \" since the beginning of 2011 , the transformative change sweeping @entity5 and the @entity4 -- along with the death of @entity23 -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat , par - ticularly as the relevance of @entity20 and its ideology has been further diminished . \" yet , fast forward to january 2014 and @entity19 \\'s top intelligence official , director of national intelligence @entity24 , advised @entity25 that @entity20 was no less capable of threatening the @entity7 and our allies than a decade earlier . soon after @entity24 acknowledged @entity20 was not a band on the run , as president @entity2 had described the terrorist enterprise , a report by terrorism expert @entity26 of the @entity27 highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the @entity3 : as restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like @entity13 , @entity28 and @entity29 during the @entity10 , those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including @entity20 and groups aligned with it . according to data compiled by @entity26 , from 2010 through 2013 , the number of @entity30 jihadist groups increased by 58 % . these groups are fueled by @entity31 , an ideology that not only informs the agenda of @entity20 , but is the source code for the agenda of the @entity20 offshoot @entity18 . most recently , absent from the @entity32 produced by the @entity2 @entity3 in february 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by @entity20 . yes , @entity23 was killed on president @entity2 \\'s watch . but contrary to what the @entity3 seemed to think in 2011 , @entity23 \\'s death has not lifted the shadow he casts over @entity19 \\'s , or our allies \\' security . indeed , within days of our new @entity32 \\'s publication date , in the seventh issue of @entity18 \\'s @entity33 @entity34 , the group \\'s leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by @entity23 , while accusing his successor , @entity35 , of steering @entity20 off the path of its former leader . meanwhile , @entity14 -- home to @entity36 , the @entity20 branch that claimed credit for the january 2015 attack in @entity37 at the office of @entity38 -- has also become a failed state . @entity36 is helmed by the second - highest - ranking official in @entity20 writ large , and the @entity2 administration views it as the most dangerous component of @entity20 \\'s global network . so it is interesting that , in the months before the @entity14 government was overthrown by @entity39 - backed rebels , president @entity2 described the @entity7 - @entity14 counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against @entity20 -- interesting because the president did not do more to help that \" partner \" government remain in power . once again , the president and his advisers appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the trajectory of events in the @entity4 . what were they thinking ? and how do they plan to combat @entity36 now ? despite what the @entity3 wants the world to believe , a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities : @entity18 controls a large amount of territory in the @entity4 , and the group is rapidly growing its ranks in places such as @entity13 and @entity40 , while at the same time inspiring and plotting attacks in the @entity41 . and , although @entity18 is trying to \" out @entity20 \" @entity20 , resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world , @entity20 itself is no less of a threat to the @entity7 and our allies today than it was in january 2014 . at the same time , the routine failures of president @entity2 and his advisers to understand the security environment , and to appropriately tailor @entity19 \\'s national security posture in a manner demanded by it , foretells more disasters lie ahead . not only @entity7 , but also our allies should be very , very afraid . indeed , president @entity2 \\'s refusal to simply call a problem like radical @entity1 by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical @entity42 groups . history has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders do n\\'t face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it . president @entity2 has the resources at his disposal to do just that . but if he wants to help define a future for the @entity4 and @entity5 in which fewer threats emanate from those regions , he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the idealists and yes - men surrounding him at the @entity3 . there is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of experimentation with pollyannaish theories about how to attain this future that have actually rendered us less safe . indeed , president @entity2 should also pay closer attention to what representatives from @entity43 states are saying behind closed doors . most of their bosses would love to be the claimants to the prize of defeating @entity18 and @entity20 . however , all of them recognize that , unless we all want things to get a whole lot worse before they might get any better , the @entity7 will have to deploy considerably more of our \" kinetic \" resources to put those victories in sight . this does not mean a ground forces - intensive response is required from us at this time . but if the president thinks it prudent to wait on our @entity43 partners to do most of the heavy lifting , he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the not - too - distant future .',\n",

( no. ) here \\'s a journey from the @entity10 to the @entity11 , around the moon and the @entity12 \\'s tilting axis , to @entity13 and the @entity14 to try to explain the complex holiday called @entity1 . and you \\'ll learn to how to color easter eggs with kool - aid . let \\'s start at the @entity10 . at the @entity10 , @entity15 began with @entity16 last week and culminated in @entity17 with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of @entity3 \\'s mortal life . @entity3 rode on the back of a donkey into @entity18 on @entity16 where crowds celebrated him as the @entity19 and laid down palm branches in his path . but the crowd and the @entity20 turned on him in the course of the week , according to the @entity21 , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection . rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray @entity22 on sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by @entity23 . afterward , the @entity24 took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his @entity25 address . @entity23 lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe . from @entity26 to @entity27 , @entity28 to @entity29 , he expressed hope that violence would end . @entity23 also does n\\'t put on airs . this week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the @entity21 account of a woman , a sinner , washing @entity3 \\' feet and anointing them with oil . let \\'s move on to old @entity18 , the birthplace of @entity1 . the church of the @entity30 in old @entity18 unifies the spot where @entity3 was crucified -- @entity31 -- with his tomb , or sepulcher . on sunday , @entity32 and @entity33 @entity7 celebrated the resurrection there . in the morning , the @entity34 , the archbishop of @entity18 , entered the basilica . then mass was held followed by a procession . but a large group of indigenous @entity7 did n\\'t join them . it \\'s not quite @entity1 yet in the @entity11 for @entity35 . they \\'ll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine @entity1 \\'s date by a different calendar than @entity7 -- the @entity36 . which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of @entity17 . a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday , right between @entity6 and @entity17 and during @entity37 . just a coincidence ? not completely , because the dates for both @entity37 -- the @entity38 holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in @entity39 -- and @entity1 are determined by moon phases , according to @entity40 . @entity1 \\'s timing is related to @entity37 , because @entity3 was crucified around then , according to the @entity21 . many jewish holidays , including @entity37 , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color . since the timing of moon phases does n\\'t jibe with @entity12 \\'s orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- @entity37 \\'s exact date moves around -- and so does @entity1 \\'s . when @entity2 bishops first convened at the @entity41 in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of @entity1 , so as to fairly reliably pin it to @entity37 : it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox . that \\'s the day in march when @entity12 \\'s axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length . but ... if the full moon fell on sunday , @entity1 would be pushed down a week . confusing ? it got worse . when the @entity42 moved from the @entity36 to the gregorian calendar , @entity35 stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for @entity1 . in 1997 , the @entity43 pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences . it did n\\'t catch on . but some odd @entity1 trappings that popped up after the @entity44 very much have -- the eggs and the bunny . the bunny is an egg - laying pagan that worships the moon . that \\'s one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one . @entity13 immigrants appear to have brought it to @entity45 in the 1700s . @entity13 historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682 . professor of medicine @entity46 described in his paper \" @entity47 ovis paschalibus , \" or \" on easter eggs , \" a custom in the @entity48 region involving a bunny and eggs , according to @entity13 public television . some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the christmas tree . but @entity46 left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in @entity13 . one common idea : during @entity49 , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them . by the time @entity1 rolled around , they were practically swimming in them . they had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit . play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts . parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the @entity1 eggs came from . if you \\'re coloring eggs this year , here \\'s an interesting tip. instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use @entity50 , @entity51 science geek @entity52 suggests . and it appears to work . just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in . they turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye . but be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , @entity52 warns . that \\'s why your tongue changes colors when you drink it . happy @entity1 ! happy @entity37 !',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) there are two paths to practicing medicine in @entity1 . there \\'s the traditional , time - tested way , where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians . then there \\'s the approach being forged in @entity2 and @entity3 : getting elected to a state legislature . lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice . in 2011 , @entity2 enacted the @entity4 , which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety . guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk . asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry . i treat brain injuries , and it \\'s part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them , like driving . and handling weapons . some of those i treat suffered their injuries by bullets , typically fired by family members or themselves . does anyone really believe i should n\\'t talk about gun safety in these cases ? it \\'s a good thing i do n\\'t practice in @entity2 . @entity2 \\'s gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it , and while a three - judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer , doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th @entity5 decides whether it will take up the case , a decision that could come down any day , the president of the @entity2 chapter of the @entity6 , dr. @entity7 , told me . he is a plaintiff in the case . in @entity3 , another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer . @entity8 goes a step beyond silencing doctors . it requires them to lie . the bill was originally a hum - drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services , a common state and federal strategy . but legislators slid in a last - minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill @entity9 tell patients the pill is reversible . that \\'s the opinion of a particular @entity10 doctor who says this can be done through risky , large doses of progesterone . but the doctor has n\\'t proven his case , and his regimen is not recommended by the @entity11 or the @entity12 . any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the @entity10 regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients , but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient - doctor relationship . i can not imagine anyone attempting to put words into the mouth of a lawyer privately consulting with a client . why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the @entity13 would never permit ? dr. @entity14 , chairwoman of the @entity3 chapter of the @entity11 , told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the @entity15 . while @entity16 and the @entity17 joined her organization in criticizing the provision , the bill passed both chambers and was recently signed by the governor . there \\'s a common relationship shared by these laws , beyond turning doctors into government spokespeople . these laws capitalize on controversial issues to divide and conquer . physicians do n\\'t all share the same opinions on abortion and guns any more than they all vote @entity18 or @entity19 . this is part of the reason the key state physicians \\' associations are n\\'t taking the lead in battling these laws . the battle is left to the specialties most affected . in @entity2 , that \\'s the state \\'s chapter of the @entity6 , since pediatricians are most likely to ask about guns in the home . in @entity3 , it \\'s the state chapter of the @entity11 carrying the torch for physician free speech . the @entity20 did n\\'t provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law , and the @entity21 told me in a statement that \" @entity22 \\'s policy is to take no position on abortion . \" representing physicians as a whole , the state medical associations have the most political clout in statehouses . the @entity23 ( @entity24 ) tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate \" @entity25 \" to the issue of physician free speech , highlighting the threat posed by @entity2 \\'s gun law in particular . members are concerned about the precedent being set . @entity26 enacted a law similar to @entity3 just days later . the @entity27 can do more . it did file a friend - of - the - court brief as part of the @entity2 legal challenge , but at this writing has n\\'t weighed in on @entity3 . the @entity22 did n\\'t sign on to a statement released last week by the @entity28 to protect the patient - provider relationship that hits hard on the new abortion laws as an affront to good medical care . its huge lobbying operations are tied up in @entity29 , while states are the main battleground over the integrity of medical practice . now that the @entity22 has won the age - old \" doc fix \" battle , ending automatic @entity30 payment cuts to doctors , perhaps it will consider assigning some of its $ 18 million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who \\'ve abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession . we have a surgeon general now , @entity31 , and he is on a national listening tour while he prepares to announce his areas of policy focus on april 22 , @entity32 , a @entity33 spokesman told me . i hope @entity31 will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health -- free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors .',\n",

( it \\'s unclear whether @entity8 , the @entity9 lawyer who submitted the proposal , is being sincere or just an ass , but the fact remains that if he collects enough signatures there appears to be no legal way of stopping it from going on the ballot . ) @entity1 \\'s \" we \\'re winning \" declaration was oddly timed , too . less than 24 hours after his talk , the governor in the next state over signed an @entity10 \" religious freedom \" bill into the law -- one that allows businesses to challenge in court local laws that forbid discriminating against customers based on sexual orientation . \" many people of faith feel their religious liberty is under attack by government action , \" @entity11 gov. @entity12 said . not to be outdone , @entity13 gov. @entity14 said he would sign a similar bill that is expected to reach his desk shortly . so we have : a fledgling proposal to kill the gays out @entity15 , laws to deny us goods and services in the heartland , and if the rhetoric of 2016 hopeful @entity16 is a barometer , a federal ban on same - sex marriage still on the @entity17 table . like others , i had foolishly hoped the upcoming general election would be one defined by bold ideas . instead , it looks like it \\'s going to be dragged down to a replay of @entity18 \\'s \" cultural war \" speech , during which he told the @entity19 : \" we stand with ( @entity20 ) against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women \" and later followed with \" there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the @entity21 itself . for this war is for the soul of @entity22 . \" progressives enjoyed poking fun at @entity16 , the @entity23 darling when he announced his presidential bid , but according to the @entity24 , \" the @entity25 [ @entity26 ] is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment . \" it \\'s not just lawmakers . @entity27 @entity28 chief justice @entity29 made headlines for telling state officials and judges to disregard a federal court ruling that overturned the state \\'s ban on same - sex marriage . and this week . a federal judge in @entity16 \\'s home state of @entity30 blocked a federal rule that would have granted married , same - sex couples access to the @entity31 , a law that helps employees stay home to take care of a severely ill spouse . it seems clear that even if @entity16 does n\\'t capture the @entity17 nomination , whoever does will undoubtedly make some concessions to appease lgbt rights backlash currently underway in conservative states . that could include one of @entity16 \\'s agenda items : a constitutional amendment banning same - sex marriage , usurping whatever ruling comes out of the @entity28 in june , when the court is expected to rule on whether such marriage is constitutionally protected . and the @entity32 can issue strongly worded statements , as it did over @entity11 \\'s new @entity10 law , and -- along with others in corporate america -- can threaten financial repercussions for discriminatory laws . but at the end of the day , it \\'s about votes . @entity1 said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . if that holds true in 2016 , \" winning \" is going to feel very strange . indeed , most 2016 hopefuls on the right have been reluctant to express support for same - sex marriage . according to former @entity13 gov. @entity33 , \" it \\'s like asking someone who \\'s @entity34 to start serving bacon - wrapped shrimp in their deli . \" @entity35 gov. @entity36 said , \" i certainly will support @entity16 and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . \" @entity37 gov. @entity38 has a long history of fighting against same sex marriage and civil unions . and @entity39 said jail turns people gay , so there \\'s that . ( he later apologized ) @entity40 polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay - friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we \\'re witnessing the final gasp of long - ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . @entity1 said he believes republicans want the @entity28 to rule in favor of same - sex marriage to provide political cover in the @entity17 primary . that may be true , but it \\'s doubtful that will allow a candidate to avoid taking a position on the wave of so - called \" religious freedom \" bills currently snaking through red - state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it \\'s raised in a debate or at a campaign stop -- especially with @entity17 controlling both the @entity41 and the @entity42 . once again , our democracy is vexed by a woefully inadequate two - party system . socially liberal , fiscally conservative independent voters may want to consider the full depth of a candidate \\'s policies before making a decision , but ultimately it may come down to a single - question : to discriminate against @entity7 people or not . unfortunately , the pending 2016 \" cultural war \" does not allow for much wiggle room beyond that . i know @entity1 and others have said \" we \\'re winning \" but sitting here , watching the life being sucked out of democracy year in and year out feels more like a defeat than a victory .',\n",

so many self - described reformers have been . swath but the peaceful transition of power from president @entity4 to president @entity1 is the first of its kind in history . and the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary @entity2 have finally had enough of the venality of their elites . for too long , @entity2 \\'s poor have been victims of their country \\'s enormous wealth . the cancer of corruption has to be cut out . i visited @entity2 in january and found a country under siege . @entity5 , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand . soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire . it \\'s a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk . yet thanks to @entity2 \\'s oil , there is also tremendous wealth in @entity5 . and when you do n\\'t really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know . graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24 - hour party palace at the @entity6 . the richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime . for a while , that system brought some stability to the government of @entity4 . but stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel . lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development . one was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run . the problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n\\'t come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government \\'s few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal . the problem of corruption went hand - in - glove with the rise of terrorism . @entity2 is not a natural , comfortable nation state ;

       "  '( @entity0 ) there was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that @entity1 retracted on sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed : the @entity2 is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus . the school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it . the @entity3 attorney general asked the law firm of @entity4 to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students . that includes how @entity2 officials handled the allegations in the discredited @entity1 article by a student the magazine called \" @entity5 , \" especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out . the alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012 , and @entity5 told the university about it the next spring . she started telling her story very publicly , including at a \" take back the night \" rally . but @entity6 police did n\\'t hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014 , in which @entity5 claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face . when a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident . in both cases , police said @entity5 refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case . but more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as @entity5 \\'s . @entity1 \\'s story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims . many women told @entity0 about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus . they \\'d call it a \" bad experience . \" others told @entity0 that there were fraternities with reputations for being \" rapey \" and for using date - rape drugs . that some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman \\'s outfit . and if a woman did report her rape , some women complained that the internal process did n\\'t seem worth it if their abuser would n\\'t be kicked out of school . @entity1 had a line in its original story : \" @entity2 \\'s emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor - code violations such as cheating on exams . and yet paradoxically , not a single student at @entity2 has ever been expelled for sexual assault . \" after the article published , @entity2 admitted this and instituted a zero - tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined , so it \\'s unclear what it means . when the story was deleted from @entity1 \\'s website , that was lost . \" you lose a lot of other people \\'s voices who were in that article , \" said @entity7 , a survivor and @entity2 student , \" and a lot of good things that could have come about . fixing problems with administration here and on our campus \" -- and , she added , across the nationo . along with the @entity4 investigation , there \\'s also an open @entity8 investigation into @entity2 by the @entity9 @entity10 as a result of a civil suit . the attorney who filed the suit , @entity11 , told @entity0 that @entity2 medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he \\'s representing , making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice . when the @entity12 \\'s 12,000 - plus - word critique is summed up , it really boils down to this : the mistake could have been avoided if the writer , @entity13 , had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of @entity5 who she claimed were with her that night . they \\'d later tell other media outlets , including @entity0 , that they remembered a very different story . @entity1 says their account would have been a red flag . and all three say they would have talked if they \\'d been called . @entity14 , one of the trio , said he felt deceived by @entity5 , but he also pointed out that @entity13 \\'s mistake in fact - checking was about one single incident , and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost . \" had she gotten in direct contact with us , it probably would n\\'t have been printed , at least in that way , \" he said . \" a lot of the article was still based in truth , but the focal point would have been different . \" it might have been less dramatic , but it would have probably focused on some of the other @entity2 students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus . \" i think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that \\'s not very common , \" @entity15 said . \" ... and i wonder if it would have been different if ( it dealt ) with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people . i think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through . something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through . now it \\'s like , \\' if i was n\\'t assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention . \\' it \\'s frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm . \" before the report came out , @entity16 , the student body president , said that some good had come from the article because it forced @entity2 to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide . but some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress . \" i do feel like there \\'s a possibility people will be afraid to come forward . if you come forward and share your story , if you do n\\'t have the date right , every detail down , you \\'ll think , \\' i \\'m going to be accused of being a liar . it \\'s easier for me to keep it to myself , \\' \" @entity15 said . \" there are very serious and unresolved questions about the university \\'s performance , \" said @entity17 , dean of the @entity12 . \" @entity1 teed that subject up . i would n\\'t say that everything about @entity1 \\'s treatment of that subject was perfect , but it certainly does n\\'t fall under the same category as their reporting about @entity5 \\'s narrative . \"',\n",
       "  '( @entity0 ) tuesday is @entity1 , the fictitious holiday marked by progressive women \\'s groups as the point in the year women would have to work to make up for \" lost \" wages as a result of the so - called wage gap . in the wake of @entity2 \\'s presidential announcement , the \" holiday \" has special meaning . @entity3 \\'s election will no doubt center on women voters , and the @entity4 women \\'s agenda centers on pay equity and fairness in the workplace . here \\'s the thing : that 77 - cent wage gap statistic is grossly overstated . it \\'s a comparison of averages -- comparing full - time working women with full - time working men -- that does n\\'t control for any of the important factors that go into determining one \\'s salary such as education , profession , title , time spent in the workforce and time spent in the office each day , to name a few . when we do control for these variables , a much smaller wage gap persists of about 4 - 6 cents , some of which may be the result of gender discrimination , but also is likely a function of women \\'s choices and different behavior , such as not negotiating as often as men do -- factors for which economists simply ca n\\'t control . the new women warriors : reviving the fight for equal rights i frequently reference my own experience as a working mom with young children as an example of someone who not only made the \" mistake \" of majoring in history but then pursued a career in the nonprofit political world -- not exactly a winning combination if a high salary is the ultimate goal . add to this the fact that i took time out of the workplace and worked part time to have a family , and my earning potential simply is n\\'t as high as some of my male counterparts . opinion : why @entity2 should take a pay cut still , conservatives -- and by extension republicans -- ought to be paying attention to @entity1 . because for many on the right the midterm election victories signaled that the \" war on women \" narrative was over . that @entity4 had overplayed their hand and that candidates such as @entity5 \\'s @entity6 simply could n\\'t succeed . in some respects , @entity7 are right . voters did choose policy substance over gendered rhetoric , and in many ways they rejected the insidious \" war on women \" narrative . the facts about the gender wage gap but women voters are valuable , and @entity1 ought to be a reminder that @entity4 are n\\'t ready to surrender . let \\'s remember a 5 - point national gender gap still remains in the @entity4 \\' favor . bottom line : the \" war on women \" narrative has n\\'t been turned off -- it \\'s simply shifted gears . and with the presidential election season just revving up , we can expect to see the \" war on women \" focus turn to the workplace , where @entity4 will claim women are paid unfairly , not given the paid leave benefits they deserve and not given the child care support they demand . many on the right fear if they try to push back on the issue of pay equity they will be skewered in the polls . but nothing could be further from the truth . map : where the gender pay gap is the widest the @entity8 conducted a randomized , controlled experiment on the issue of the wage gap , and we found that not surprisingly the progressive message in favor of the @entity9 -- a legislative \" solution \" to close the pay gap -- increased support for the bill but surprisingly was not effective at increasing support for @entity4 . in short , if the right is silent on the issue , the left has the potential to win the battle but not the war . it \\'s tempting on days such as @entity1 for @entity7 to want to lie low -- to ignore the rhetoric and hope it will all go away by wednesday . but the reality is that \\'s the worst thing conservatives can do . the public is open to hearing the real story on pay equity , and conservatives need to be ready and willing to respond .',\n",

long chain of migrations , expulsions , and exiles sparked by @entity1 \\'s imperial ambition and commercial interests , the post-colonial anger of @entity11 leaders , and now mass economic desperation and political strife . long after the formal end of @entity1 colonialism , these @entity7 , @entity8 , and @entity5 have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries . it also affects the treatment of @entity11 who settle in @entity1 . @entity5 is an example of the long reach of @entity1 imperialism . @entity5 was for a brief period an incorporated province of @entity1 , on the model of @entity12 , and @entity5 families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship \\'s persecution of those who resisted @entity1 occupation . over 100,000 @entity5 men , women , and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s , and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed . col. @entity13 , who ruled from 1969 to 2011 , was born during the @entity1 occupation of his country , and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as @entity14 , who was hanged by the fascists in front of 20,000 of his people in 1931 . in 1970 , soon after he took power , @entity13 struck back , expelling the remaining @entity1 community in @entity5 . some of those people had grown up entirely in @entity5 . they arrived in @entity1 for the first time , at some of the same ports receiving migrants today . this political intervention did not spell the end of @entity1 - @entity5 commercial dealings , which grew out of colonial - era relations that had made @entity5 @entity1 \\'s biggest oil supplier . since 2004 , @entity1 and @entity5 have been directly connected by the @entity15 natural gas pipeline , which runs below the @entity4 , on the same axis as many migrant boats . commercial concerns , and the cozy relationship of then - prime minister @entity16 and @entity13 , also lay behind a historic 2008 @entity17 between @entity1 and @entity5 , which promised infrastructure and other aid to @entity5 worth the equivalent of $ 5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by @entity1 during the decades of colonial rule . until his death in 2011 , despite deals with @entity1 and the @entity18 to control departures from his borders , @entity13 intermittently used @entity3 fears of mass arrivals of migrants from @entity5 as a political weapon . given @entity3 \\'s geography , this weapon was pointed particularly at @entity1 , @entity5 \\'s former master , and the principal target of @entity13 \\'s post-colonial revenge politics . few @entity1 learn about this colonial history and its legacies , even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former @entity1 colonies and elsewhere are on the rise . upon her appointment in 2013 as minister of integration , @entity19 , an @entity1 of @entity20 origin , faced ugly racist attacks from fellow @entity1 politicians , including a comment that she looked like an orangutan . this climate has encouraged those who wish to rehabilitate the \" heroes \" of fascist imperialism . in 2012 , the town of @entity21 built a publicly - funded memorial to general @entity22 , known as \" the butcher of @entity23 \" for his brutal repression of @entity5 resisters in the 1920s -- and for the massacre of @entity24 civilians he ordered in response to a 1937 attempt on his life . this colonial history and its long - term consequences can help us understand @entity1 \\' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores . @entity1 rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly , and yet migrants who remain in @entity1 are often subject to racist attacks . it is ironic that the name chosen for the sea rescue operation organized by the @entity25 in 2013 was the slogan of the fascist \\'s dictatorship \\'s bid to control the @entity4 : @entity26 . the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to @entity18 budget restrictions . it seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the @entity1 government to its past aggressions : an admirable and courageous initiative -- advanced under an imperialist banner . the @entity1 government deserves the full support of the @entity18 as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis . but it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past . at 40 years old , @entity1 prime minister @entity27 is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the @entity4 . setting a new course on this issue is in @entity1 \\'s interest , now more than ever .',\n",

@entity10 representation on the council . even though 70 % of @entity0 \\'s 21,000 people are black , five of the six current @entity5 members and the mayor are white . the council was cited along with the @entity16 , which has three black officers , as a symbol of white power in a majority black city . \" we have to get out of this law enforcement for business , \" said candidate @entity17 , coordinator of the computer network security program at @entity18 . @entity17 referred to the scathing report by the @entity10 @entity19 that found @entity0 issued fines and traffic tickets to generate revenue for the city . \" that \\'s not a good thing , \" @entity17 said as he stood in the drizzle at a polling station , hoping to persuade voters who were still undecided . the polls close here at 7 p.m. results are not expected until a few hours later . @entity20 , a 67 -

( he later apologized ) @entity40 polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay - friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we \\'re witnessing the final gasp of long - ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . @entity1 said he believes republicans want the @entity28 to rule in favor of same - sex marriage to provide political cover in the @entity17 primary . that may be true , but it \\'s doubtful that will allow a candidate to avoid taking a position on the wave of so - called \" religious freedom \" bills currently snaking through red - state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it \\'s raised in a debate or at a campaign stop -- especially with @entity17 controlling both the @entity41 and the @entity42 . once again , our democracy is vexed by a woefully inadequate two - party system . socially liberal , fiscally conservative independent voters may want to consider the full depth of a candidate \\'s policies before making a decision , but ultimately it may come down to a single - question : to discriminate against @entity7 people or not . unfortunately , the pending 2016 \" cultural war \" does not allow for much wiggle room beyond that . i know @entity1 and others have said \" we \\'re winning \" but sitting here , watching the life being sucked out of democracy year in and year out feels more like a defeat than a victory .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) it \\'s only a few weeks since the first presidential announcement but already it feels like the campaign is in high gear . a number of politicians have officially announced their candidacies and the outline of their messages is starting to emerge . @entity1 , who announced last week , even jumped into her black van for a road trip out to @entity2 , including a pit stop at @entity3 along the way . although the campaign has barely begun , most of the candidates -- and some probable candidates -- are already starting to make mistakes . most of the mistakes will simply be blips along the way , but some of them might end up being more damaging if they feed into negative perceptions that voters have about the candidates . here are a few notable mistakes in the past few weeks : trying to separate himself from the pack , @entity4 gov. @entity5 called for substantial cuts to @entity6 . he also promised to reverse the marijuana legalization laws that many states have been enacting in response to ballot initiatives . both of these statements could come back to bite him , should he run for president . while @entity5 sees @entity6 cuts as a way to \" go big \" in crafting a platform for a possible presidential run , as many @entity7 have discovered @entity6 is a very popular program and one that has strong support from @entity8 who are over 60 -- a big part of the electorate . on marijuana legalization , @entity5 inserted himself into an issue that has growing public support in red and blue states , especially with the younger and independent voters who @entity5 is promising to bring into a potential campaign . if @entity5 continues to veer right it will be harder to sell himself as the moderate in the race , and yet there is little chance that he will secure conservative votes over someone like sen. @entity9 . sen. @entity9 impressed many observers when he announced his candidacy at @entity10 . but soon after he did something that took many people by surprise . the @entity11 senator , who has been one of the leading opponents of president @entity12 \\'s health care plan , acknowledged that he would be enrolling in the @entity13 program since his wife was taking a leave of absence from her job to help with the campaign . it will be hard for him to live this one down . since he wants to sell himself as the authentic conservative and the @entity7 who will give @entity14 their biggest toughest fight , the fact that he decided to join a program he has railed against -- and tied up @entity15 with -- will raise questions about whether he is just another politician , and not a true zealot over @entity13 . the decision will offer plenty of fodder to democrats who want to remind voters that @entity7 rail against government even when they and their constituents depend on it . if anyone faces authenticity questions , it is @entity16 sen. @entity17 . as the so - called \" libertarian \" in the campaign , @entity17 is aiming to attract younger republicans who otherwise are not interested in the party . he is also hoping to bring back hard - core anti-government conservatives who believed that their party has moved too far away from their original goals . @entity17 has already struggled to justify some of his recent announcements , such as calling for a more aggressive war against @entity18 and his statements against gay marriage . but after announcing his presidency , he brought himself more trouble with his aggressive interaction with \" today \" host @entity19 . @entity17 became clearly aggravated with what the host and went so far as go explain how to conduct the interview . the interview focused most media attention on @entity17 \\'s temper and his interactions with women rather than his message . in an interview on @entity20 , he put his finger to his lips and said \" shhh , calm down \" to anchor @entity21 . both moments revealed a side of his character than until that moment had been somewhat off the radar . \" you \\'re coming off as pretty thin - skinned in your interviews , \" @entity22 of @entity23 told the senator . thus far , @entity24 has had a fairly smooth opening but during her first week on the trail , she did make a minor mistake . while speaking in @entity25 , @entity2 , @entity24 said during a discussion about immigration reform that \" all my grandparents , you know , came over here \" even though only one was really an immigrant . her staff corrected the statements . \" her grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and , as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants . as has been correctly pointed out , while her grandfather was an immigrant , it appears that @entity1 \\'s grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the @entity8 in the early 1880s . \" @entity24 \\'s campaign video seemed pitch perfect to many observers , as she largely removed herself from the story line . her drive to @entity2 demonstrated that she is n\\'t likely to repeat the kinds of mistakes that she made in 2008 when she failed to take the nuts and bolts of caucus organization seriously . although the entire opening certainly had the flavor of a made for television event , it has generally been well - received . clearly the biggest \" gaffe \" in the run - up to the @entity24 campaign was in how she handled the story of her use of a private server rather than the @entity26 email system . although she dragged out the campaign announcement , she certainly should have had more of the team in place given how much attention she would receive . at first she stumbled in her response , giving the accusers time to spin the story as reflecting a tendency to hide information and suggesting that she was still the untruthful person so many people suspected . @entity27 announced his presidential run after the biggest announcement of them all : @entity1 . given that @entity27 is not one of the most well - known of the candidates , outside of @entity7 political circles , his timing was not perfect . the announcement was overshadowed by @entity24 \\'s video and drive to @entity2 . coming on the heels of @entity12 \\'s historic discussions with @entity28 , the timing and sequence did n\\'t help the senator to get the kind of initial buzz that he was hoping for . although in the long run this wo n\\'t make a difference , it might have been wise for him to delay the announcement and give his campaign some breathing space . all of these are still relatively small missteps in the very start of the campaign . and we know from social scientists than individual gaffes and mistakes do n\\'t really have a big impact on the outcome of these contests , so much as the \" fundamentals \" like the ability to raise campaign contributions and the endorsements from political elites . still , mistakes can play a role in campaigns . while individual mistakes might be fleeting , collectively , these kinds of moments can shape how voters think of candidates when the time comes for a vote .',\n",

( there have been ) significant gains against @entity4 -- particularly in @entity8 -- and it \\'s no coincidence we \\'ve seen isis make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in @entity9 . it \\'s asymmetric warfare , they know they can not hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw ... then take initiative elsewhere . they have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere . it continues their image of initiative , of shocking , of reshaping the world -- which is what they are trying to do . @entity1 : what does the map tell us about the coalition \\'s strategy ? @entity10 : it \\'s very telling . there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the @entity3 forces . it \\'s a push against the front line of @entity4 rather than being brave and creative and going in behind @entity4 \\'s lines and breaking it up . what this is n\\'t is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push . the capability you need ( for this kind of warfare ) is much more high - tech than the capabilities the @entity3 have . those capabilities are available in the region -- @entity11 , @entity12 and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it \\'s very interesting that the @entity13 nations have not developed an effective coalition to target @entity4 which is an existential threat . @entity1 : what about @entity14 ? @entity4 seems to be winning there . @entity10 : @entity14 has been a potential battlefield for the past decade . but in this context ( @entity4 ) will ... be pushing in @entity14 because that \\'s an area they have lots of support . it also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains . the concept of success is hugely important to them -- it \\'s what sustains the recruitment effort of @entity4 . nobody wants to join a bunch of losers , so it \\'s very important for them to be seen to be succeeding . above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media . they are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in @entity15 and killing refugees in camps like @entity16 . but where it counts they are not standing and fighting .',\n",

( fortunately , saturday 's shaking was half that intensity ) . still , this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for @entity5 as it emerges from a long - running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily . we have to hope that recovery from both can somehow take place despite the enormous challenges ahead .\",\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) the @entity1 has named a new defendant in the war on drugs , and the charges are serious indeed . a 15 - count indictment filed in federal court in @entity2 bristles with accusations of conspiracies , transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions , violations of the @entity3 , misbranding charges , and money laundering charges . who is this menace to society ? @entity4 . yes , the courier delivery service . wait , can companies even be charged with crimes ? where would a @entity4 be incarcerated ? is there a corporate @entity5 ? how does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit ? it turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person . it \\'s a practice the @entity6 has approved of for over a century . in fact , in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people . corporations do n\\'t have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes . imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive , but corporate convictions , on the other hand , turn tidy profits for the @entity7 government , with zero prison overhead . even if corporations can be held criminally liable , should a courier service like @entity4 be held liable for \" possessing \" what bad guys may send through the service ? the answer , according to @entity4 , is not just \" no , \" but a \" no \" so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom . the company maintains that it is innocent . it has a point . \" possession \" is an elusive concept . when it comes to drugs , the law recognizes two kinds of possession : actual and constructive . actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband . when you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket , you \" actually \" possess those things . the somewhat hazier concept of \" constructive possession \" means you can \" possess \" something without even having it on your person , as long as you have ownership , dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found . for example , the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000 @entity8 pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway , you \" constructively \" possessed them . conversely , sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle , but not \" possess \" it either actually or constructively , in the eyes of the law . such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home , walk up to your door and hand you a package , completely ignorant about what is inside it . it \\'s hard to argue the @entity9 guy intentionally \" possessed \" your subscription to porno mags , in their nondescript brown packaging . that is the idea behind the \" common carrier \" exception to possession , and a large part of @entity4 \\'s compelling legal argument . a \" common carrier \" is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation . the public policy reasons behind \" common carrier \" exemptions make sense ; the industry simply could n\\'t function if every driver , courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of @entity8 had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door . that would lead to an absurd result . that \\'s why the @entity3 and the @entity10 allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances , so long as it is in the usual course of their business . of course , this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves \" common carriers . \" that \\'s why the \" usual course of business \" language acts as an additional safety measure . in court papers , @entity4 \\'s lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from @entity11 to @entity12 . this would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier , since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public , generally . on the other hand , @entity4 argues that it is indeed a common carrier , performing the normal duties of a common carrier , because ( a ) it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and ( b ) it offers its services to the public generally . it \\'s hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband . does this mean a @entity13 bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger ? the bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs . but if the guy boards the bus with a @entity14 t - shirt and a set of bongos , should n\\'t the driver at least have a hunch ? that seems dangerously close to profiling . is this another illogical straw man argument ? maybe . obviously , the @entity1 disagrees , which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution . according to the indictment , from at least as early as 2004 , the @entity15 , the @entity16 , and members of @entity17 put @entity4 on notice that illegal internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the @entity3 , the @entity10 , and numerous state laws . the indictment alleges that as early as 2004 , @entity4 knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts . @entity4 \\'s couriers in @entity18 , @entity19 , and @entity20 expressed safety concerns that were circulated to @entity4 senior management . the @entity1 is making the argument that even though @entity4 carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public , @entity4 knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity . it raises a larger question , though : why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we ca n\\'t even incarcerate ? the answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs , and drug smugglers smuggle them : @entity21 . @entity22 . the government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case , it would be to force @entity4 to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation . the government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in \" deferred prosecution agreements . \" the reason you do n\\'t see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements ; for a company , a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence , whether or not it \\'s found guilty . still , every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines . do n\\'t get me wrong : i \\'m all about prosecuting the black market , especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with \" @entity23 \" in the subject line , for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom . i want those guys locked up for sure . i \\'m just not sure that @entity4 has anything to do with the kingpins of the \" @entity24 \" email campaign . the @entity1 \\'s underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain . it makes good strategic sense . it might seem like good financial sense in the short run , with the millions in fines extracted from corporations , but that money has to come from somewhere . it \\'s just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights . it probably does n\\'t make good legal sense either . yes , we have been treating corporations as fictional \" persons \" for centuries in some ways -- but it \\'s silly to treat them as persons in all ways . @entity4 has a strong argument for dismissal in this case , but even if not , it wo n\\'t be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon .',\n",

\" . both types of questions show the profound disconnect between most physicians , who tend not to speak unless they are certain in their expertise on a topic , and the way the media industry works . dr. @entity1 \\'s show does n\\'t require he stay up late at night prepping for the next day -- he has an office full of production staff behind him . let \\'s take it as a given that not every physician across @entity17 , or at @entity2 , has to agree with what dr. @entity1 says on his program . i certainly do n\\'t . does he have the right to say it ?

       "  '( @entity0 ) by now , you probably have a position regarding the controversy over @entity1 \\'s religious freedom law . you applaud the growing chorus of companies blasting the law as an invitation for businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians , using religion as a cover . or , like @entity1 gov. @entity2 , you are surprised at the backlash and maintain that it is basically a copy of a law that is already in the books at the federal level and 19 other states . the issue drives a wedge because , well , the debate over religious freedom and gay rights is always heated , but also because the interpretations and motives behind the law can be questioned . whichever side you \\'re on , here are five things you might not have considered when thinking about this controversy . these points might not change your mind , but offer context to better understand the uproar . as the author of the 1993 federal @entity3 ( @entity3 ) , sen. @entity4 is one who can offer clarity over the controversy surrounding @entity1 \\'s version of the law . @entity4 mocks @entity1 \\'s contention that the state law is simply a mirror of the 22 - year - old federal law . \" that may be true only if you \\'re using a funhouse mirror , \" @entity4 wrote on his @entity5 page . the federal law was intended to protect individual \\'s religious freedom from government intervention , he said . the @entity1 law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom , he contends . also , the law was envisioned to protect the religious freedoms of individuals , while the @entity1 law also protects private companies , @entity4 said . so , how can the law \\'s supporters claim it is basically a copy of the federal law ? if you look at the purpose of the law , the language in the federal and @entity1 religious freedom laws are indeed nearly indistinguishable . in short -- the government can not interfere with a person \\'s religious practices unless there is a compelling government interest to do so . the uproar is over that fact that the @entity1 law expands the reach of the religious protections to include private companies and cases where the government is not involved . other states previously passed their own version of the religious freedom law -- @entity1 became the 20th . but other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the @entity1 law does . the key difference in the @entity1 law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense . this is how it could make a difference : in 2006 , @entity6 contacted a photographer about shooting her commitment ceremony with her partner . this was in @entity7 , a state with a religious freedom law at the time of the dispute . the company , @entity8 , refused the job because of the co-owner \\'s religious beliefs . @entity6 sued @entity8 for discrimination , and the company defended itself by citing the law . the photography studio lost the case because the court ruled that it could not use the religious freedom law because the dispute was between two private parties and not a government entity . what would happen if that case happened today in @entity1 , with the new , expanded religious freedom law ? for sure , the case would have proceeded to trial , said @entity9 , a law professor at @entity10 . the photography studio would have had the chance to make its argument in court that it denied the service because of religious reasons . would the outcome have been the same ? would an @entity1 jury side with the company that refused service to a couple because of their sexual orientation ? in a letter expressing concern about the @entity1 law , a group of 30 legal scholars argued that what @entity1 has done is expanded the scope of the law to the point that religious considerations might trump discrimination concerns . \" in our expert opinion , the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state @entity3 will more likely create confusion , conflict , and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in @entity1 while undermining the state \\'s ability to enforce other compelling interests , \" the letter , whose signatories included many @entity1 law professors , stated . these concerns are based on speculation of what might happen , said @entity11 , a constitutional law professor at @entity12 . yes , the @entity1 law makes it clear that individuals and private companies can use the religious freedom law as a defense , he said . \" but , just because you raise the defense does not mean it will be successful . \" those who try to defend their discriminatory actions in court tend to lose , @entity11 said . in his opinion , if @entity8 had been able to use the law as a defense in @entity7 , it still likely would have lost the case . what \\'s clear is that @entity1 \\'s law increases the potential pool of people who can defend themselves claiming religious freedom . the success of such arguments is to be seen . in the meantime , some are already hatching plans on how to test the law , including @entity13 , founder of @entity14 , who argued on @entity0 that the law should protect his right to smoke pot. much is being made of the fact that the first religious freedom law was signed by president @entity15 more than 20 years ago . there was bipartisan support in 1993 , so why the commotion over a similar law in 2015 , some ask ? context , timing and intent have changed the way these laws are viewed . the federal law was written by two democrats , @entity4 and the late sen. @entity16 . today , it is being championed by @entity17 . the law came into being after two @entity18 in @entity19 were fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic because they had consumed peyote , the hallucinogenic cactus . they were denied unemployment benefits , and they sued the state , claiming that the peyote was part of their religious customs . they lost the case . there was outrage over the decision , and the law was created as a remedy . as envisioned by its authors , it would protect the freedoms of religious minorities . over the years , the law helped a number of people -- a @entity20 prisoner won the right to grow a short beard , a @entity21 priest was allowed to sacrifice a goat on special religious occasions , and a native american boy received an exception to his school \\'s policy banning long hair on boys . the law was on the books for years , with little attention paid to it . but @entity9 says it is no coincidence that the religious freedom laws became popular at the state level just as the gay rights and marriage equality movement made historic steps . many states are using the laws to carve out exceptions to allow @entity22 to deny services to same - sex couples . @entity9 said . \" the timing is beyond a coincidence , \" he said . \" we are having an interest in @entity3 at the time same - sex marriage is coming forward . \" though not enshrined in the law , critics accuse the states pursuing the laws of using them to justify discrimination by the majority religion . @entity11 said the history of the state religious freedom laws shows that they have not turned into conduits for discrimination . the expanded laws might mean more people will defend themselves using it , but most will likely lose , he said . \" the moral outrage over this reflects how uninformed people are on the history of the @entity3 , \" he said . so we \\'ve established that the biggest difference between the federal law and the @entity1 law is the scope : in @entity1 , the law can be raised as a defense in private disputes , while the federal law applies only to government matters . not so fast . according to @entity11 , the interpretations of the federal religious freedom law are not uniform . four @entity23 circuit courts of appeals have ruled that the federal law can be used as a defense in cases involving private parties . two other appeals courts have ruled that this is not allowed . and then , there is the @entity24 case . @entity24 , citing the federal religious freedom law , argued that it should not have to provide contraception coverage through insurance to its employees via @entity25 because it was against the owners \\' beliefs . and , @entity24 won the case before the @entity26 . the ruling , in effect , expanded the reach of the federal law to include a business . the @entity24 decision , plus the appeals courts rulings , may have opened the door for states like @entity1 to be explicit about its expansion of the law . one way to look at it , @entity11 said , is that @entity1 simply clarified and codified something that is hazy in the federal courts . the outrage over the @entity1 law is that it can be used to deny services to the @entity27 on the ground of religious beliefs . some may rightfully ask , \" where was the outrage before the religious freedom law ? \" @entity1 does not have an nondiscrimination law that protects people based on sexual orientation or gender identity . in that sense , the religious freedom law is not necessary for those who want to discriminate against gays and lesbians . even before the controversial @entity1 law was passed , if a restaurant denied service to a gay couple , the couple might be able to sue , but not for discrimination . for that matter , there is also no federal law that protects the @entity28 community . according to the @entity29 , lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people are sometimes fired , denied a promotion or harassed in the workplace . and their recourse is limited . with the proliferation of religious freedom state laws , nondiscrimination laws become even more important . another hypothetical outcome of the @entity7 case involving the lesbian couple and the photography studio . if @entity7 had the same religious freedom law as @entity1 , the case would have gone to trial . but @entity7 has a nondiscrimination law that protects the @entity28 community , it and it would have provided a strong counter-argument to the religious freedom claim . in @entity1 , that protection would be lacking . ( it gets more complicated when some local governments , like the city of @entity30 , do have nondiscrimination ordinances ) . for this reason , @entity9 suggests that a \" fix \" for the @entity1 law would be the passage of a nondiscrimination law . or , at the very least , an exception written into the religious freedom bill that protects from such discrimination .',\n",

based journalists arrived on the scene before the team did . journalists on the ground corroborated that report . once the team entered the university complex , the situation was quickly defused , journalists and the police source said . @entity11 , a spokesman for @entity1 \\'s president and deputy president , defended the response time , telling @entity2 there is always criticism regarding whether \" you reacted as fast as you have or should n\\'t have . \" \" with the benefit of hindsight you can always say things could have been done better , \" he said , adding that @entity1 authorities saved a lot of students and \" got the job done . \" foreign minister @entity12 echoed those remarks in a monday interview with @entity2 , saying the response was sufficient and denying reports that it was the elite rapid response team alone that brought an end to the situation . \" we have a military garrison in @entity0 , and the work began immediately after the attack was reported and continued for a number of hours until we were able to rescue 663 students of the 800 students that had been taken hostage by these terrorists . so the response was adequate , \" she said . she repeated @entity13 \\'s assertion that dubbing the response slow is a reaction that comes only with the luxury of hindsight . \" obviously when parents are grieving and the country is mourning , it \\'s always easy to fall back on things like that , but i can assure you that we took very quick action as soon as this was reported , \" @entity14 said . \" obviously hindsight is always 20/20 . we did everything that we could do . \" the @entity1 government says @entity15 is the mastermind of thursday \\'s terrorist attack on @entity5 . the country \\'s @entity16 singled out @entity17 , a senior leader of @entity3 , on @entity18 . he is also known by the aliases @entity19 and @entity20 , it said . @entity17 is \" credited with having an extensive terrorist network within @entity1 , \" according to a @entity1 ministry document given to @entity2 . the ministry posted a \" most wanted \" notice for @entity17 . it offers a reward of 20 million @entity1 shillings , about $ 215,000 . \" we appeal to anyone with any info on # @entity20 to share with relevant authorities and security agencies , \" the @entity16 posted on @entity18 . @entity17 is in charge of external operations against @entity1 , the document says , and he is the regional commander within @entity3 in charge of the @entity21 region . in this role , he commands the militia along the border and \" is responsible for cross-border incursions in the country . \" his position as one of @entity3 \\'s top field commanders in southern @entity4 has brought him into direct conflict with @entity1 troops deployed as part of @entity22 forces in the country . \" this is a man who has a lot of grudges against the @entity1 , \" said @entity23 , an associate professor at @entity24 \\'s @entity25 and author of \" @entity3 in @entity4 : the @entity26 and @entity27 . \" @entity17 \\'s network extends within the @entity28 refugee camp , the document says . @entity28 is the world \\'s biggest refugee camp , home to thousands of people , according to the @entity29 . it \\'s in @entity1 \\'s @entity30 near @entity4 . @entity0 , the town where the university attack took place , is about 150 kilometers ( 90 miles ) from the @entity4 border . it \\'s within \" striking distance \" of @entity17 \\'s stronghold in @entity4 \\'s @entity21 province , @entity23 told @entity2 . but he noted that @entity17 is better known \" for tactical military attacks rather than terrorist attacks . \" @entity31 dorm \\'s scene of slaughter over the weekend , @entity3 promised to bring about \" another bloodbath \" in @entity1 . though the terrorist group is based in @entity4 , it has n\\'t confined its violence to the lawless nation . in 2013 , militants attacked @entity10 \\'s upscale @entity32 . @entity17 has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the past few years , including december \\'s attack on a quarry in a @entity1 village near the @entity4 border , which killed at least 36 people . in that attack , @entity3 militants separated non-muslim workers from their @entity33 counterparts and killed them . @entity17 is @entity1 and has three wives and three siblings , including two with links to @entity3 , the document says . he \\'s from a clan , the @entity34 , that has a heavy presence in @entity1 and @entity4 , @entity23 said . \" the borders historically have been meaningless to them , \" he said . @entity2 exclusive : exposing smuggler routes across the @entity4 -

       "  '( @entity0 ) it seems almost silly to be writing about baseball in the context of recent events . except it is n\\'t . last weekend , as @entity1 reacted to the death of @entity2 , the young man who died last week from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody , @entity3 had a problem on its hands . saturday \\'s game between the @entity4 and @entity5 had gone into extra innings in @entity6 , with plenty of fans for both teams glued to their seats . @entity5 fans feel at home in @entity7 -- a so - called retro urban park built to embrace the luxuries of modern stadiums while maintaining that nostalgic feel -- because much of it was based on @entity5 \\'s @entity8 . the @entity5 faithful are used to being in the heart of a city to watch sports . but when the @entity4 finally pulled out a win in the 10th inning , 36,000 fans remained in their seats . they had been asked to do so by @entity1 officials due to \" ongoing public safety issues . \" the riots of @entity1 , the peaceful marches of @entity1 , the fury and unrest of @entity1 did not seem to have had much to do with baseball . but as the always-wise @entity9 magazine writer ( and @entity1 native ) @entity10 \\' take on the situation quickly went viral , it became clear that the @entity4 \\'s home stand presented a problem . monday \\'s game against the @entity11 : postponed less than an hour before the first pitch . tuesday \\'s game against the @entity11 : also postponed . such action by @entity3 is not without precedent . in 1967 in @entity12 , the 12th street riots forced the @entity13 to postpone one game and relocate others ( to @entity1 , no less ) . after the assassination of @entity14 , @entity3 postponed opening day games out of fear of mob violence . in the wake of the 1992 verdict in the @entity15 beating , the @entity16 postponed several games . the entire league went on hiatus in the wake of the terrorism and violence of september 11 , 2001 . politics threaten sports all the time . from the demonstrations against the @entity17 government before last summer \\'s @entity18 to the massacre of protesting students days before the @entity19 of the @entity20 in 1968 , sports knows well that it sits within the larger context of the world . our deep investment in our teams -- beyond the tax dollars that construct the stadiums and the salaries players make ( and the profits the owners and sponsors draw ) -- is supposed to work to create community , to unify . cheering for the home team is supposed to create a sense of belonging . \" it \\'s interesting that i have not yet heard anyone say that baseball or sport can heal this wound , \" @entity21 , professor of american studies at @entity22 and editor of \" rooting for the @entity23 : @entity24 \" told me . \" people did say that in the weeks after 9/11 . this is not 9/11 -- not even close . but it is a serious social and cultural rupture . painful . \" what happens next is striking . after two postponements , the @entity4 will play @entity25 on wednesday , but no one else will be invited . in an unprecedented move by major league baseball , the public is not invited to the final game of the series , moved to the afternoon in accordance with the curfew imposed by @entity1 \\'s mayor . while there are a few examples of fan-less games being played in the @entity26 , none have been for such reasons , while in @entity27 , there have been a handful of incidents in which soccer teams have been punished for fan behavior with fan-less games . without fans , does baseball mean anything ? when the new @entity6 made its debut in 1992 , people heralded the return of the old - time stadium smack in the middle of the city . but are the residents of that city ready to reminisce about the so - called good old days ?

       "  '( @entity0 ) supported by @entity1 intelligence and supplied with advanced @entity1 - made weaponry , @entity2 jets began airstrikes in @entity3 late last month in the name of what the kingdom \\'s @entity4 ambassador described as \" restoring the legitimate government \" and protecting a \" @entity3 constitution and elections . \" the need to protect constitutions and elections is a rather strange message from the representative of an absolute monarchy . indeed , @entity2 motives in @entity3 likely have nothing to do with protecting the country \\'s \" legitimate government , \" its constitution or its electoral process . so what is really going on ? the kingdom \\'s real motives seem clear if one looks at @entity2 monarchy \\'s history of not allowing regional competition of any kind , while consistently combating efforts to build democratic governments that empower the people . this approach was evident in 2013 , when @entity2 voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of @entity5 in @entity6 , which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary @entity2 policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the @entity7 . the @entity2 goal is simple : prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self - determination . and the excuse of \" resisting @entity8 \\'s influence , \" meanwhile , appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster . for example , in 2009 , the @entity9 ( more accurately described as the @entity10 ) were not yet receiving help from @entity8 , yet for weeks the kingdom pummeled them with airstrikes , following @entity2 claims of a @entity9 incursion . true , the @entity11 movement now benefits from @entity8 support . but it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region . with all this in mind , the @entity1 decision to stand behind the @entity2 attack on @entity3 can best be described as misguided . although the @entity9 movement \\'s rhetoric is unquestionably anti-american , it has not targeted any @entity1 interests . in fact , when the @entity1 @entity12 packed up in @entity13 in january , leaving a fleet of over 20 armored suvs behind at the airport , the @entity9 reportedly said they would round up the cars and deliver them to a @entity14 representative in @entity3 . and while the @entity9 did not welcome the @entity1 presence in @entity3 , they did not interfere with @entity1 operations against @entity15 in the country . but one of the biggest miscalculations has been that @entity1 policy has adopted the @entity2 - @entity16 narrative on @entity3 , effectively placing @entity2 ambitions to control @entity3 above previous @entity1 priorities like destroying the safe haven for @entity15 there . indeed , the @entity17 administration appears to have abandoned @entity3 to @entity2 machinations . this reality was underscored when @entity1 @entity18 spokesperson @entity19 effectively endorsed @entity2 bombing , saying the \" @entity2 have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in @entity3 on their security . \" the implication here seems to be that any country \" concerned \" about its neighbors can go ahead and bomb them , a view that risks creating a dangerous precedent . back in september , @entity20 spokesman @entity21 described @entity3 as a success story in the war on terrorism , explaining that the @entity1 priority in @entity3 was not to establish a \" jeffersonian democracy \" but to prevent @entity3 from becoming a safe - haven for @entity15 and affiliates . yet if that policy goal remains in place , then it must be acknowledged that the @entity2 war on @entity3 will not only undermine the @entity1 aim of preventing @entity15 from making @entity3 a safe haven , but also undermine broader @entity1 efforts in @entity3 . the reality is that @entity2 and @entity22 jets are effectively acting as @entity15 \\'s air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot @entity15 from several @entity3 regions . interestingly , while @entity2 deployed about 100 aircraft against the @entity9 on the second day of its offensive , it reportedly deployed a mere four fighter jets in the early @entity1 - led campaign against @entity23 last year . regardless , the results of the @entity2 campaign are unlikely to be positive -- one only need look at the way a much smaller @entity9 force than today was able to outfox the @entity2 military back in 2009 . back then , @entity9 forces consisted of only a few hundred fighters , but they shocked the @entity2 army , reportedly capturing @entity2 equipment and forcing the evacuation of almost 250 @entity2 villages as it seized territory along the border . today , that ragtag group of @entity9 rebels has been replaced by a much larger group called @entity10 , modeled after @entity24 \\'s @entity25 . back in 2009 , the rebels were limited to parts of the @entity26 region and were self - funded , although @entity3 claimed they had minor assistance from the late @entity27 leader @entity28 . yet despite this , they were still able to withstand some 90 days of @entity2 bombardment . today , the @entity29 is receiving political , financial and military support from @entity8 . already , the @entity2 government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports , and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions . the situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues . what should be done now ?

awaited anti-domestic violence law , which is expected to get a reading before the @entity5 this summer . this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential @entity6 hosted in @entity4 , during which @entity7 famously declared that \" women \\'s rights are human rights . \" i first met @entity1 at a conference several years ago , at a time when there were very few women in @entity3 \\'s weiquan or \" rights defense \" movement . it was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them as \" babes \" or \" little sisters , \" even in professional — and ostensibly progressive — settings . as women \\'s rights activists , @entity1 and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the @entity3 government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second - class citizens . by the time we met again two years later , @entity1 and her young \" direct - action \" feminist colleagues were clearly off and running . they staged small , public \" performance art \" protests that attracted media headlines , energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women \\'s rights movement , and pushed women \\'s rights into the national consciousness and onto the government \\'s agenda . @entity1 had an upbringing typical of her times . she comes from the countryside , which for many has changed beyond recognition within their lifetimes . in recent decades the economy has soared , but her generation is confronting the unhappy consequences of unchecked growth : pollution , unsafe foods and growing inequality between rich and poor . like many parents , she worries about how to find untainted milk powder for her infant boy , and whether to keep her child with her in the city or to send him to his grandparents in the countryside for a quieter , safer upbringing . many in @entity8 and her colleagues \\' generation are clear - eyed about the problems of @entity3 \\'s development model , and some want to address those . @entity1 joined @entity9 , a nonprofit organization that promotes social equality , whether it is between sexes or among people with and without disabilities , and later founded the women \\'s rights organization @entity10 . and it is in @entity11 that she became particularly attuned to the challenges confronting young women in modern @entity3 . @entity1 and her colleagues have used innovative tactics with a certain shock factor — \" occupying \" public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women , donning blood - spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence , shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women — that raises awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate , especially with young women in the country . perhaps this is what the government finds threatening : that these activists epitomize the spirit of the times . they are young , confident , ready to challenge established norms , and most importantly , they feel responsible for their society and they want to improve it . as @entity3 prepares to mark the anniversary of the @entity6 in september , it will be harder for the authorities to justify detaining these activists . but even if they are released , their work promoting women \\'s rights will have become exponentially more difficult . the women will now be labeled \" sensitive \" individuals at a time when the authorities are increasingly paranoid about independent groups , their role in fostering nonviolent protests and the overthrow of oppressive governments ( known as \" color revolutions \" ) , and foreign funding of civil society organizations . what @entity1 and her colleagues are now enduring is consistent with a broader government effort to strangle independent activism . authorities have harassed and detained an ever expanding list of activists , and imprisoned others , but they have also tried to co-opt some groups by allowing them to provide services the government finds acceptable , so long as they abandon their activism . this kind of \" differentiated management \" of nongovernmental organizations — punishing some but co-opting others — may work to neutralize some of the more outspoken groups . but ultimately the desires for change among ordinary people that make @entity1 and her friends \\' campaigns so popular are unlikely to be answered through \" authoritarian activism \" alone . the @entity12 now faces a dizzying array of challenges , not least that younger generations do not identify with the party or its values like past generations . rather than lengthening its list of challenges , the party could resolve some and lessen concerns about its legitimacy by freeing and engaging activists like @entity1 and her colleagues , rather than treating them as criminals .',\n",

in 2014 , there were 0 . the current government has argued that its objective was to end the people smuggling trade -- and this required secrecy concerning the extent of its operations and turn - backs . so we do not know how many boats tried to enter @entity8 waters with asylum seekers . it also appears that no asylum seekers drowned in @entity8 waters during the 2013 - 2014 period . @entity9 explained the tactic of secrecy and turn - back in the following statement : \" we are in a fierce contest with these people smugglers . and if we were at war , we would n\\'t be giving out information that is of use to the enemy just because we might have an idle curiosity about it ourselves . \" if we accept that these responses have worked , the question for @entity8 \\'s government is whether it is sustainable , and whether it alleviating the flow of asylum seekers in the larger @entity22 . in sum , if this policy had to end due to its financial cost , has this policy been a \" solution \" ? the later years of the @entity23 administration saw both policy and budget departures from 2001 \\'s \" @entity24 , \" which first introduced the excision zones and temporary protection visas as deterrents to asylum seekers . the @entity12 government abandoned temporary protection visas altogether but retained the excision zones ; this occurred in a period of heightened regional instability , leading to an increase of asylum seekers under the @entity12 era . the earlier @entity23 years of deterrence did not provide long - term solutions regarding the regional flow of asylum seekers . at present , in the greater @entity25 region , we may see potential regional pressures finding a way to @entity8 shores . the drowning of asylum seekers who sought passage via people smugglers appear to have increased , in particular , in the @entity26 . at the same time , the number of asylum seekers attempting to flee within the @entity22 has increased ; they are just not making it to @entity8 yet . on cost alone , it is hard to see @entity8 \\'s approach to asylum seekers working or being affordable in @entity10 . for @entity8 , these short - term solutions have been extraordinarily expensive . a 2014 report by the @entity27 estimated that the @entity8 government may have spent as much as a $ 10 billion ( $ 7.72 billion ) on its detention policies since mid- 2007 -- and that each person in offshore detention costs the government as much as a $ 440,000 ( $ 343,000 ) . for comparison , we estimate that a similar model to respond to the 170,000 refugees and migrants who arrived last year in @entity3 would cost a $ 75 billion ( $ 58.5 billion ) . the @entity8 government \\'s ability to \" stop the boats \" -- or at least keep asylum seekers offshore -- depends on a number of factors , including tolerance from @entity18 , significant spending devoted to asylum deterrence and weathering international condemnation for violating the human rights of asylum seekers . the consequences of a policy of no asylum and no refuge in @entity8 for those who arrived by boat from july 2013 has been asylum seekers placed in situations where they are vulnerable to abuse , as we saw with the death of an @entity28 refugee in the @entity29 on @entity30 and sexual and physical assault of asylum seekers held at the @entity29 in @entity16 . the @entity8 government \\'s interception of asylum seekers attempting to reach @entity8 by boat , and then their relocation to @entity16 or @entity15 ( or perhaps @entity17 ) , does not remove or absolve the human rights obligations that @entity8 has to these populations . the operation to stop and return the boats , called \" @entity31 \" has been politically tumultuous for @entity8 \\'s relationship with @entity18 . returning boats to international waters potentially violates @entity8 \\'s obligation to international maritime law ; push - backs to @entity18 waters violates @entity18 \\'s sovereignty and has placed people at great risk . in 2013 and 2014 , the @entity8 government sought the @entity19 government \\'s assistance to intercept those attempting to flee , and receive those who had already fled the country , at a time when that government was under investigation by the @entity32 for war crimes and crimes against humanity . as the situation in @entity10 illustrates , just because people are not making it to your shoreline to seek asylum does not mean people stop attempting asylum . in the short term , the \" stop the boats \" approach appears to be working for the @entity8 government . it is questionable whether this policy is financially or politically sustainable in the long term . it certainly has not ended people smuggling or people \\'s attempts to seek asylum in the wider @entity22 . @entity33 argues that the recent tragedy in @entity3 is not just about how to manage search and rescue operations , but requires consistent and long - term engagement with the root causes of refugee flows . this is a message that both the @entity4 and @entity8 should heed . @entity3 is a good example of the failure of trying to stop asylum seekers with deterrence . the @entity3 government ended its @entity34 search and rescue program last autumn , which was effective but was also costing the @entity3 government € 9.5 million per month . it was replaced by a much smaller @entity4 - run program , @entity35 , which has a smaller patrol area and a budget of less than a third that of @entity34 . the @entity36 , @entity37 , has noted that this new program is totally inadequate and \" more geared to border control and policing the seas than to saving lives \" . in @entity3 , both @entity34 and @entity35 were stemming an inevitable tide given the political instability in @entity38 . the migrants currently in @entity2 are in a perilous limbo , with a growing civil war having displaced more than 400,000 @entity2 and with @entity39 noting that the conflict and collapse of government authority has \" eliminated any semblance of law and order from large parts of @entity2 . \" second , such policies have significant legal implications . the @entity40 has ruled that these policies are legal as long as they take place outside of @entity8 \\'s migration zone , an area that today includes all of @entity8 territory for the purposes of boat arrivals . by contrast , the @entity41 ruled in 2012 that efforts by the @entity3 government to return migrants intercepted at sea to @entity2 violated its legal obligations under the @entity42 because the migrants \" were under the continuous and exclusive de jure and de facto control of the @entity3 authorities . \" this suggests that similar practices to @entity8 \\'s would be illegal under the @entity42 . copyright 2015 @entity43 . some rights reserved .',\n",

the fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public , but maybe there is more to it . the situation hits on a popular argument on the media and @entity6 : what do we think of millennials ? reflecting on his most recent class , @entity1 said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered . he mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics , and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration . the other factor is a failure of k - 12 education , said @entity1 , who has met college students who do n\\'t know how to convert fractions to decimals . \" what i \\'m trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance , \" he said . in a statement , @entity9 , the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at @entity7 , said the entire class will not be failed . \" each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester , \" @entity9 said . \" the university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies . \" the flurry of attention is unwelcome and @entity1 fears it will affect his career in academia . but it \\'s likely his story will have a short shelf life . people probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline . but he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere . he said he feels a public shaming of sorts . online public shaming has become a research topic of its own . people who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance . \" this is really destroying my life , \" @entity1 said .',\n",

       "  '( @entity0 ) we might never truly comprehend what drove co-pilot @entity1 to crash @entity2 into the @entity3 on march 24 , killing everyone on board . the latest report shows that he sped up the descent of the plane to its doom . it \\'s terrifying . as the investigation unfolds , we will learn more about to what extent @entity1 kept his mental illness secret , or how much help he sought . how much did his battle with depression affect his fitness to fly ? should he have walked away from his job ? should his doctors have sounded alarm bells ? his case raises larger and important issues about people who are burdened with mental illness and the pressure of its stigma . too often and for too long , people with mental illness have been regarded by others around them as disasters waiting to happen . when we do n\\'t distinguish between people with a mental illness who are dangerous to society and those who are a danger to no one , we reinforce a pernicious idea that \\'s both bad for society and bad for those with mental illness . some people feel a need to keep their mental illness a secret while others decline to seek help . that \\'s why in our public and more private discourse , people with mental illness and the rest of society must talk about mental illness in a way that does n\\'t drive some into the darkness . we need to understand this malady as an illness and not a personal failing . and we have to recognize that \" mental illness \" is a broad category encompassing many different challenges that affect people in a variety of ways . people with mental illness are no more violent than the rest of the population and with proper treatment , many can recover and live healthy , productive lives . we must encourage them to open up , and when they do , we must listen to them and take their cries for help seriously . it was n\\'t that long ago that a diagnosis of cancer was a tightly - kept secret that many victims of the deadly malady kept from family members , friends and especially employers . but that changed dramatically over the years as people with cancer , their family members and caregivers came together to educate and change public opinion about the disease . similarly , and with the courageous example of @entity4 , we \\'ve seen perceptions about @entity5 change for the better , as people learn more about what it is and is n\\'t . time to talk about depression that \\'s the kind of transformation we need around perceptions of mental illness through a better - informed public discussion . we have to put policies in place that encourage more openness without the severe repercussions people with mental illness fear . that includes enforcing and even strengthening the kind of protections we already have in place ( through laws and regulations like the @entity6 for @entity7 ) for individuals who disclose their disability . we also need to address the dilemma health care providers often face when they feel that strict patient privacy requirements inhibit them from alerting others to behaviors that could pose a public risk . it \\'s a difficult balance . sooner rather than later , policy leaders need to explore a way to provide greater flexibility in patient privacy regulations to enable health care providers to identify seriously ill persons who could potentially pose a harm to innocent people . at the same time , we must reassure those who forthrightly reveal their struggles with mental illness that they can still carry on their lives in ways that will be valuable to their communities , families and employers . that can start with urging employers not to dismiss anyone who discloses his or her mental illness and to retrain them for other appropriate positions . if companies ban them from the workforce or from other roles in society , we will just be shifting the problem elsewhere and perpetuating the stigma that dangerously drives them underground . we wo n\\'t pretend that this is an easy problem to solve . but , awful as @entity8 9525 tragedy was , the case may galvanize a discussion and reexamination that is long overdue . we need to build awareness and support for those who suffer from mental illness .',\n",

year - old daughter , @entity5 . the divers stopped searching months ago because of the winter and water conditions , and the @entity6 ferry remains on the bottom of the sea floor . the @entity2 sank on april 16 , killing 304 people , mostly high school students who were on their way to a field trip to @entity7 , off @entity6 \\'s southern coast . \" we kept waiting with belief in finding our daughter . i thought once , \\' somebody will be the last person and what if it \\'s @entity8 -

by - one , bringing the youngsters back to land in black body bags where they were met with the gut - wrenching cries of their families . on thursday , the one year anniversary of the disaster , @entity6 \\'s president @entity11 called for the salvage of the @entity2 \\'s wreck \" as soon as possible . \" \" recently , there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage @entity2 ferry . i believe that it is now time to earnestly prepare to salvage , \" she said . a government study on raising the ferry released last week identified a crane and floating dock as the safest way to look for the missing . the @entity2 ferry is over 20 years old and there are fears it could fall apart during the extraction , according to the @entity12 . the agency anticipates a complicated technical operation to remove the ferry , which would weigh about 10,200 tons above water . the process could take over a year and a half , and that it would cost the @entity6 government anywhere from $ 91 million to $ 182 million . the victims \\' families have demanded that the ship be recovered in order to thoroughly investigate the accident . since the days immediately after the disaster , families have criticized the government over its response . communication over the rescue efforts were jumbled , paving way for rumors and hoaxes . criticism swirled over the @entity10 \\'s effectiveness in carrying out the rescue operation . the captain of the first coast guard ship sent to rescue the @entity2 passengers was found guilty of negligence and making false reports . the recovery efforts have also taken a deadly toll with a total of six deaths -- a diver searching the @entity2 died in may , and in july , five people died after a helicopter carrying emergency workers involved in the operation crashed . @entity9 , the @entity6 president , pledged major reforms , dismantled the coast guard and vowed an investigation into what went wrong . that promised investigation has been hampered by politics and disagreements between the families and the government over who should participate in the investigation . earlier this month , several dozens of family members marched to @entity0 from @entity13 , the suburb where most of the students had resided . some of the families shaved their heads to demand political action . several laws have been passed to inspect cargo weight and increase oversight in the industry . in the case of @entity2 , the ferry was found to be loaded with double its capacity . its cargo was n\\'t secured properly , which threw the ship off balance as the containers tumbled and knocked the vessel off balance . an inexperienced crew and redesigns of the ship to handle more passengers and cargo were also cited as factors in the disaster . the sinking spurred a debate about the shortcomings of the government and what preventive measures should have been taken . \" the tragedy of @entity2 was also virtually caused by accumulation of corruption , irregularity and going blind eyes , \" @entity4 said on thursday . \" corruption and deep - rooted evil are issues that can lead to taking away people \\'s lives . we take this very seriously . \" in the immediate aftermath , @entity6 prosecutors arrested the captain , crew members and business associates . @entity2 \\'s captain , @entity14 , who was widely derided for jumping to safety , was sentenced to 36 years in prison for abandonment causing death and injury , and violating sea laws . in july , the body of a billionaire @entity15 , who was believed to have connections to the company that owned the ferry , was found decomposing in a plum field . but some families say that wider , systematic problems that allowed the disaster to occur have n\\'t been addressed . whether the ferry will be raised and an independent investigation will be held remains to be seen . @entity1 \\'s @entity16 and journalist @entity17 contributed to this report in @entity0 .',\n",

more than a year later , that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the @entity23 and the @entity19 delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed @entity3 \\'s case with the @entity24 administration as well as @entity4 . the congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one , according to one of those lawmakers and a @entity25 aide . \" we do n\\'t get choked up too often at work , \" @entity26 said as she held back tears . \" but this is really hard . \" @entity27 is a foreign policy adviser to sen. @entity28 , @entity19 , who worked closely on the case . after the @entity6 announced that @entity3 had been accidentally killed in a january @entity5 drone strike , the aide \\'s first call was to @entity3 \\'s daughters . \" myself and my colleague worked really closely with them , talked to them all the time ... they \\'re just such good people , \" @entity26 said of the family . \" there \\'s a personal connection there . \" @entity28 and his staff had tracked the @entity3 case since news of his abduction surfaced in august 2011 , but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case , @entity28 \\'s staff joined forces with rep. @entity29 , the @entity23 \\' congressman , and began setting up meetings for the family . @entity28 \\'s staff set up meetings for the senator and @entity3 \\'s family with everyone from the @entity5 special representative to @entity7 and @entity4 to the @entity4 ambassador in @entity0 . @entity28 and sen. @entity30 , @entity19 , wrote to president @entity24 , calling on the @entity5 to beef up efforts to secure @entity3 \\'s release and dedicate more resources to the cause . and the staff and lawmakers helped the @entity31 weave through the network of agencies -- from the @entity32 to the @entity33 and the @entity6 -- working to bring @entity3 home . \" we focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated , \" @entity34 told @entity1 on thursday . \" the government is a bureaucracy , and you have to make sure that it \\'s working . \" but for the @entity23 and the families of other @entity5 hostages held by terror groups abroad , the government has n\\'t always worked well enough -- a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on @entity35 who worked to help them . @entity2 hostage @entity3 killed \" unfortunately , the assistance we received from other elements of the @entity36 was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years , \" @entity37 said in a statement thursday . \" we hope that my husband \\'s death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the @entity5 government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families . \" it \\'s a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of @entity5 hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient @entity5 government efforts to bring their loved ones home . @entity34 was \" saddened , disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring @entity3 home , \" he said in a statement thursday . and in an interview with @entity1 later in the day , he strayed away from blaming the @entity24 administration or people in various @entity5 agencies , instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system . the @entity3 family \\'s frustration with that system boiled over last summer when @entity18 , the @entity16 sergeant , was released by a @entity15 - affiliated group in exchange for five @entity38 prisoners . the @entity5 policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception . \" it \\'s one of those things where it \\'s both there \\'s some hope , but at the same time it caused them some great frustration , \" @entity34 recalled , saying the family asked : \" why not @entity3 ?

       "  '( @entity0 ) supported by @entity1 intelligence and supplied with advanced @entity1 - made weaponry , @entity2 jets began airstrikes in @entity3 late last month in the name of what the kingdom \\'s @entity4 ambassador described as \" restoring the legitimate government \" and protecting a \" @entity3 constitution and elections . \" the need to protect constitutions and elections is a rather strange message from the representative of an absolute monarchy . indeed , @entity2 motives in @entity3 likely have nothing to do with protecting the country \\'s \" legitimate government , \" its constitution or its electoral process . so what is really going on ? the kingdom \\'s real motives seem clear if one looks at @entity2 monarchy \\'s history of not allowing regional competition of any kind , while consistently combating efforts to build democratic governments that empower the people . this approach was evident in 2013 , when @entity2 voiced its support for the military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of @entity5 in @entity6 , which was in keeping with counterrevolutionary @entity2 policies that aimed to contain or reverse the results of the @entity7 . the @entity2 goal is simple : prevent the rise of any popularly supported government in the region that seeks self - determination . and the excuse of \" resisting @entity8 \\'s influence , \" meanwhile , appears to be nothing but sectarian bluster . for example , in 2009 , the @entity9 ( more accurately described as the @entity10 ) were not yet receiving help from @entity8 , yet for weeks the kingdom pummeled them with airstrikes , following @entity2 claims of a @entity9 incursion . true , the @entity11 movement now benefits from @entity8 support . but it is far from the only group getting help from outside sources in the region . with all this in mind , the @entity1 decision to stand behind the @entity2 attack on @entity3 can best be described as misguided . although the @entity9 movement \\'s rhetoric is unquestionably anti-american , it has not targeted any @entity1 interests . in fact , when the @entity1 @entity12 packed up in @entity13 in january , leaving a fleet of over 20 armored suvs behind at the airport , the @entity9 reportedly said they would round up the cars and deliver them to a @entity14 representative in @entity3 . and while the @entity9 did not welcome the @entity1 presence in @entity3 , they did not interfere with @entity1 operations against @entity15 in the country . but one of the biggest miscalculations has been that @entity1 policy has adopted the @entity2 - @entity16 narrative on @entity3 , effectively placing @entity2 ambitions to control @entity3 above previous @entity1 priorities like destroying the safe haven for @entity15 there . indeed , the @entity17 administration appears to have abandoned @entity3 to @entity2 machinations . this reality was underscored when @entity1 @entity18 spokesperson @entity19 effectively endorsed @entity2 bombing , saying the \" @entity2 have legitimate concerns about the possible impact of current events in @entity3 on their security . \" the implication here seems to be that any country \" concerned \" about its neighbors can go ahead and bomb them , a view that risks creating a dangerous precedent . back in september , @entity20 spokesman @entity21 described @entity3 as a success story in the war on terrorism , explaining that the @entity1 priority in @entity3 was not to establish a \" jeffersonian democracy \" but to prevent @entity3 from becoming a safe - haven for @entity15 and affiliates . yet if that policy goal remains in place , then it must be acknowledged that the @entity2 war on @entity3 will not only undermine the @entity1 aim of preventing @entity15 from making @entity3 a safe haven , but also undermine broader @entity1 efforts in @entity3 . the reality is that @entity2 and @entity22 jets are effectively acting as @entity15 \\'s air force by bombing the same group that had managed to uproot @entity15 from several @entity3 regions . interestingly , while @entity2 deployed about 100 aircraft against the @entity9 on the second day of its offensive , it reportedly deployed a mere four fighter jets in the early @entity1 - led campaign against @entity23 last year . regardless , the results of the @entity2 campaign are unlikely to be positive -- one only need look at the way a much smaller @entity9 force than today was able to outfox the @entity2 military back in 2009 . back then , @entity9 forces consisted of only a few hundred fighters , but they shocked the @entity2 army , reportedly capturing @entity2 equipment and forcing the evacuation of almost 250 @entity2 villages as it seized territory along the border . today , that ragtag group of @entity9 rebels has been replaced by a much larger group called @entity10 , modeled after @entity24 \\'s @entity25 . back in 2009 , the rebels were limited to parts of the @entity26 region and were self - funded , although @entity3 claimed they had minor assistance from the late @entity27 leader @entity28 . yet despite this , they were still able to withstand some 90 days of @entity2 bombardment . today , the @entity29 is receiving political , financial and military support from @entity8 . already , the @entity2 government was forced to cancel flights to southern airports , and it has also reportedly suspended classes in schools in the border regions . the situation is only likely to deteriorate as the fighting continues . what should be done now ? @entity2 interests in @entity3 should not replace those of the @entity1 . with this in mind , the @entity17 administration should work to find an immediate political solution to the conflict , one that can be embraced by the various @entity3 factions . a change in approach is essential not only because the @entity2 - led war on @entity3 is wrong and destined to fail , but because it might end up further opening the @entity3 door to @entity8 . but perhaps most importantly , by supporting a self - interested @entity2 campaign , the @entity1 may actually empower an @entity15 with the potential still to do great harm to the @entity1 .',\n",
